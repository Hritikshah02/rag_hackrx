      "question": "How does Newton define 'quantity of motion' and how is it distinct from 'force'?",
      "answer": "Newton defines the quantity of motion as the measure arising from the velocity and quantity of matter conjunctly, which differs from force as the vis insita, an innate force of matter, is a power of resisting any change in its state.",

    },
    {
      "question": "According to Newton, what are the three laws of motion and how do they apply in celestial mechanics?",
      "answer": "The provided documents do not explicitly list Newton's three laws of motion or detail their specific application in celestial mechanics, but they do state that the principle of Universal Gravitation, which characterizes The Principia, was deduced from the motion of the moon and Kepler's laws, and that Newton demonstrated Kepler's laws to be true through his greater law.",

    },
    {
      "question": "How does Newton derive Kepler's Second Law (equal areas in equal times) from his laws of motion and gravitation?",
      "answer": "Context 6 states that from the second of Kepler's laws, Newton inferred that the force retaining the planet in its orbit was always directed to the sun.",
      "retrieved_chunks_file": "transaction_logs/20250806_195148/query_3_chunks.json"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does Newton demonstrate that gravity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between two masses?",
      "answer": "Newton demonstrates that gravity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between two masses by showing that the force of gravity towards every one of them, considered apart, is reciprocally as the square of the distance of places from the center of the planet.",
      "retrieved_chunks_file": "transaction_logs/20250806_195148/query_4_chunks.json"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is Newton's argument for why gravitational force must act on all masses universally?",
      "answer": "Newton's argument for universal gravitational force is that all bodies, celestial and terrestrial, have no difference in substance but only in modes and forms, and therefore must possess forces proportional to their quantities of matter.",
      "retrieved_chunks_file": "transaction_logs/20250806_195148/query_5_chunks.json"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does Newton explain the perturbation of planetary orbits due to other planets?",
      "answer": "Newton explains that the mutual actions of the planets upon one another are so small that they can be neglected, and these actions disturb the motions of the planets around the sun less than if those motions were performed about a sun at rest.",
      "retrieved_chunks_file": "transaction_logs/20250806_195148/query_6_chunks.json"
    },
    {
      "question": "What mathematical tools did Newton use in Principia that were precursors to calculus, and why didn't he use standard calculus notation?",
      "answer": "Newton used the \"Method of Fluxions\" and geometrical synthesis, and he censured the handling of geometrical subjects by algebraical calculations, favoring the geometrical method instead of standard calculus notation.",
      "retrieved_chunks_file": "transaction_logs/20250806_195148/query_7_chunks.json"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does Newton use the concept of centripetal force to explain orbital motion?",
      "answer": "Newton explains orbital motion by stating that centripetal forces, which are directed towards a center, retain bodies in their orbits by opposing their endeavor to recede in straight lines.",
      "retrieved_chunks_file": "transaction_logs/20250806_195148/query_8_chunks.json"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does Newton handle motion in resisting media, such as air or fluids?",
      "answer": "Newton handles motion in resisting media by considering that resistance arises from the inactivity of matter, which is proportional to the quantity of matter, and in continued mediums like water, the resistance is diminished by half due to the chain-like pressing of fluid particles.",
      "retrieved_chunks_file": "transaction_logs/20250806_195148/query_9_chunks.json"
    },
    {
      "question": "In what way does Newton's notion of absolute space and time differ from relative motion, and how does it support his laws?",
      "answer": "Newton's notion of absolute space and time, which flows equably without regard to anything external and remains similar and immovable respectively, supports his laws by providing an immovable framework against which relative motions, which are translations between movable relative places, can be accurately measured and understood as parts of entire absolute motions.",

      "question": "Who was the grandfather of Isaac Newton?",
      "answer": "The document does not state who Isaac Newton's grandfather was, only mentioning a grandfather named Robert Newton.",

    },
    {
      "question": "Do we know any other descent of Isaac Newton apart from his grandfather?",
      "answer": "Beyond his grandfather, Robert Newton, the descent of Sir Isaac Newton cannot with certainty be traced.",
