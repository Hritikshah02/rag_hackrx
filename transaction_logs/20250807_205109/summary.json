      "question": "If an insured person takes treatment for arthritis at home because no hospital beds are available, under what circumstances would these expenses NOT be covered, even if a doctor declares the treatment was medically required?",

      "answer": "The claim is admissible because the dependent child (over 18 and under 26, unmarried, unemployed) is covered under the dependent‑coverage clause and dental surgery performed after an accident is expressly covered, so the insured must submit the claim form with invoices, prescriptions and reports to the insurer (or TPA) for assessment and settlement within 15 days of receipt of the last necessary document as per the claim‑submission process.",

      "answer": "For the day‑care cataract procedure the claim is filed as a Day‑Care Treatment claim (Clause II.A.11) by submitting the completed claim form together with the insured’s photo‑ID, policy copy, attending physician’s certificate and prescription, all original bills, discharge summary (if any), and the original hospital invoice within 15 days of discharge (or immediately if cash‑less) as required under Clause VI.3/VI.4, and for the subsequent 5‑day inpatient admission in a non‑network hospital the claim is treated as an In‑patient Hospitalisation claim (Clause III.A.1/III.A.2) requiring the same set of documents (including original final hospital bill, discharge certificate, detailed bill break‑up, medical practitioner’s certificate, etc.) to be submitted within 15 days of discharge for reimbursement, with payment made up‑front at the non‑network hospital and the claim processed under the same 15‑day document‑submission timeline and assessment process described in Clause VI.4.",

What is the claim eligibility for the newborn's treatment expenses, referencing definitions, exclusions, and newborn cover terms?",
      "answer": "The newborn’s treatment expenses are claim‑eligible under the maternity benefit because the policy states that the baby is covered from day 1 within the family sum insured and, for a C‑section, up to INR 50,000 (plus up to INR 5,000 pre‑post‑natal expenses) may be reimbursed for IPD care of the first two children.",

Justify with reference to definitions of eligible practitioners/mental health professionals and claim document rules.",
      "answer": "No, because although a Clinical Psychologist qualifies as a mental‑health professional and a GP’s prescription meets the “attending medical practitioner” requirement, the policy’s claim‑document rules require a hospital‑issued discharge certificate (or attending medical practitioner’s certificate) and a discharge summary from the hospital, which a psychologist‑certified discharge summary does not satisfy.",

      "answer": "Both the pre‑hospitalisation expenses incurred 18 days before admission and the post‑hospitalisation diagnostics and pharmacy expenses incurred 20 days after discharge are claimable, provided the insurer has accepted the related inpatient hospitalisation claim, the expenses relate to the same illness, and the amounts fall within the policy‑specified number‑of‑days and monetary limits for pre‑ and post‑hospitalisation cover.",

      "answer": "The dependent child’s coverage continues only until the day they turn 27, at which point, because they no longer meet the eligibility (over‑26) they cease to be a dependent and their cover terminates immediately (unless a specific continuation agreement is in place) and must be removed from the policy by written notification in accordance with the policy’s deletion protocol.",

      "answer": "After a partial rejection for missing documentation, the TPA/ insurer must give the insured up to ten working days (with up to three reminders) to provide the missing documents, may deduct the amount and settle the claim if otherwise valid, and if a final rejection is issued the insured may request reconsideration within fifteen days of the decision and, if still dissatisfied, may lodge a grievance through the company’s customer‑care channels (website, toll‑free, email or grievance officer) or the Insurance Ombudsman as prescribed.",

      "answer": "Yes, because under the definition of Hospitalisation (Context 1) admission of less than 24 hours is permissible for specified procedures/treatments, so a minimally invasive surgery that now requires only 22 hours qualifies as a covered hospitalisation provided it is one of the specified procedures.",

      "answer": "The insured must immediately notify the insurer (or its call‑centre) in writing of the emergency evacuation so that the insurer can pre‑authorise the air‑ambulance transport after its specialists determine the medical necessity, and after the subsequent inpatient admission the insured must submit a duly‑completed claim form together with the original air‑ambulance ticket, hospital admission and discharge documents, the treating practitioner’s certificate and prescription, all invoices and receipts (including the air‑ambulance ticket and any other required invoices), photo‑ID and policy copy within the prescribed time, after which the insurer will scrutinise the documents, apply the proportionate clause, co‑pay, limits and any opted‑deductible in the order set in the policy and settle the claim within 15 days of receipt of the last necessary document (or within 45 days if an investigation is required).",

      "question": "Explain how the policy treats waiting periods for a specific illness (e.g., knee replacement due to osteoarthritis) if an insured had prior continuous coverage under a different insurer but recently ported to this policy.",
      "answer": "The policy waives the specific‑illness waiting period (including knee replacement for osteoarthritis), and although prior continuous coverage under another insurer would normally reduce the waiting period to the extent of prior coverage, the waiver already eliminates any waiting period, so the claim is covered without any waiting period.",
