      "question": "How does Newton define 'quantity of motion' and how is it distinct from 'force'?",
      "answer": "Newton defines 'quantity of motion' as the measure arising from the velocity and quantity of matter conjunctly, while 'force', particularly the motive quantity of a centripetal force, is defined as the measure proportional to the motion it generates in a given time, distinguishing it as a cause or generator of motion rather than a measure of the motion itself.",

    {
      "question": "According to Newton, what are the three laws of motion and how do they apply in celestial mechanics?",
      "answer": "ANSWER: The provided contexts mention \"the Laws of Motion\" as part of the content of Newton's work, particularly in the first two books of \"THE MATHEMATICAL PRINCIPLES OF NATURAL PHILOSOPHY\" which are occupied with the laws and conditions of motions and forces, but they do not explicitly define the three laws of motion or detail how they apply in celestial mechanics.",

    {
      "question": "How does Newton derive Kepler's Second Law (equal areas in equal times) from his laws of motion and gravitation?",
      "answer": "ANSWER: Newton demonstrated Kepler's three laws, including the Second Law (equal areas in equal times), to be true by his greater law, the principle of Universal Gravitation.",

    },
    {
      "question": "How does Newton demonstrate that gravity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between two masses?",
      "answer": "Newton demonstrates that gravity is reciprocally proportional to the square of the distance by showing that if bodies describe conic sections, their centripetal forces are reciprocally proportional to the squares of the distance, and this is accurately demonstrable from the quiescence of the aphelion points, as a very small aberration from that proportion would produce a sensible motion of the apsides.",

    },
    {
      "question": "What is Newton's argument for why gravitational force must act on all masses universally?",
      "answer": "ANSWER: Newton argued that gravitational force must act on all masses universally because it arises from the universal nature of matter, residing in every particle and being proportional to the quantity of matter, not mutable by forms, implying its presence in all bodies, celestial and terrestrial, due to a lack of difference in substance.",

    },
    {
      "question": "How does Newton explain the perturbation of planetary orbits due to other planets?",
      "answer": "ANSWER: Newton explains that the mutual actions of planets one upon another cause small disturbances to their motions, and these perturbations are greater with more revolving bodies or if accelerative attractions are not reciprocally as the squares of their distances from the greatest body.",

    },
    {
      "question": "What mathematical tools did Newton use in Principia that were precursors to calculus, and why didn't he use standard calculus notation?",
      "answer": "ANSWER: Newton used his invented Method of Fluxions and his celebrated Binomial Theorem as mathematical tools, and he did not use standard calculus notation because he censured the handling of Geometrical subjects by Algebraical calculations, favoring the Geometrical Method.",

    },
    {
      "question": "How does Newton use the concept of centripetal force to explain orbital motion?",
      "answer": "ANSWER: Newton explains orbital motion by defining centripetal force as that which is directed towards a center and retains bodies in their orbits, such as ellipses or circles, preventing them from flying off in straight lines.",

    },
    {
      "question": "How does Newton handle motion in resisting media, such as air or fluids?",
      "answer": "ANSWER: Newton handles motion in resisting media by defining resistance as arising from the inactivity of matter and the motion excited by the projectile in the fluid, noting that for swiftly moving bodies, resistance is nearly in the duplicate ratio of velocity and is not much diminished by the subtilty of the medium, with propositions primarily treating non-elastic fluids while acknowledging a slight augmentation for elastic ones.",

    },
    {
      "question": "In what way does Newton's notion of absolute space and time differ from relative motion, and how does it support his laws?",
      "answer": "Newton's notion of absolute time flows equably without regard to anything external and absolute space remains always similar and immovable, defining absolute motion as a translation within this fixed space, unlike relative concepts which are sensible, movable measures; this distinction is essential for philosophical disquisitions to abstract from senses and determine true motions, thus providing an unchanging foundation for the principles and laws.",

      "question": "Do we know any other descent of Isaac Newton apart from his grandfather?",
      "answer": "Beyond his grandfather Robert Newton, Isaac Newton's known descent includes his father John Newton, his mother Harriet Ayscough, and his maternal grandfather James Ayscough.",
