In slow  motions     the  resist\nance  may    be a little less, because          the figure of a globe is more           adapted    to\nmotion    than   the figure of a cylinder         described        with    the same diameter.      In\nswift motions         the resistance     may     be a little greater, because        the     elasticity\nand   compression       of the fluid do not increase       in the          duplicate    ratio of the\nvelocity.
