      "answer": "The child, being an unmarried, unemployed dependent aged 18‑26, is covered under the policy’s dependent‑up‑to‑26 provision and, because dental surgery after an accident is expressly covered (Dental Treatment Covered if due to accident and requiring hospitalisation), the claim is admissible and must be submitted with the claim form, invoices and treating physician’s prescription to the insurer/TPA for assessment and settlement within 15 days of receipt of the last necessary document, following the cash‑less or reimbursement process set out in Clause VI.",

      "answer": "To add the 3‑year‑old adopted child the policyholder must submit a written endorsement request (including proof of adoption and the child’s details) to the insurer, pay any additional premium and obtain the insurer’s approval within the stipulated addition window (generally within 30 days of policy inception or before the end of the month following the child’s birth if covered under maternity) as required by the addition/deletion clause, and the insurer may refuse cover if the child does not meet the eligibility criteria (both parents must be covered concurrently, the group must have at least seven members, the request is not made within the required period, or the required premium is not paid).",

What is the claim eligibility for the newborn's treatment expenses, referencing definitions, exclusions, and newborn cover terms?",
      "answer": "The newborn is covered from day 1 under the maternity benefit, so the newborn’s intensive‑care expenses are claimable up to the family sum‑insured (subject to the INR 50 000 C‑section limit) because the policy expressly states “Baby Covered from Day 1 within Family Sum Insured” and does not list newborn death as an exclusion.",

Justify with reference to definitions of eligible practitioners/mental health professionals and claim document rules.",

      "answer": "ECG electrodes are only payable for OT/ICU cases (up to five per case or one set every second day in ICU) and thus not admissible for routine oral chemotherapy, whereas sterilized gloves are payable (unsterilized not) and therefore can be reimbursed if they are sterilized.",

      "answer": "Both the pre‑hospitalisation expenses incurred 18 days before admission and the post‑hospitalisation diagnostics and pharmacy expenses incurred 20 days after discharge can be claimed because, under the Pre‑hospitalisation Medical Expenses Cover (definition 36) and the Post‑hospitalisation Medical Expenses Cover (definition 37), expenses incurred within the defined pre‑ and post‑hospitalisation periods for the same illness are reimbursable provided an inpatient claim has been accepted, and a relapse occurring within 45 days of discharge (as per the relapse clause) is treated as the same claim, subject to the policy’s day‑limits and sum‑insured limits.",

      "answer": "The claim is not eligible because the policy defines hospitalisation as a minimum of 24 consecutive in‑patient‑care hours and only “specified procedures/treatments” may be admitted for less than 24 hours, and no such exception is identified for the minimally‑invasive surgery.",

      "question": "Explain how the policy treats waiting periods for a specific illness (e.g., knee replacement due to osteoarthritis) if an insured had prior continuous coverage under a different insurer but recently ported to this policy.",
      "answer": "Because the policy waives the specific‑illness waiting period and, under the portability/migration provisions, reduces (and in this policy’s case fully waives) any waiting period for a listed condition such as knee‑replacement due to osteoarthritis to the extent of the insured’s prior continuous coverage with the previous insurer.",

      "question": "Suppose the insured's hospitalization was for evaluation and all tests and imaging were negative, leading to a decision for no treatment. Are these expenses claimable? Discuss using definitions and exclusions.",
      "answer": "No, because under the Standard Permanent Exclusions (Code‑Excl04) expenses related to an admission primarily for diagnostics and evaluation, or any diagnostic expenses not incidental to current diagnosis and treatment, are excluded, so a hospitalization that only yielded negative tests and required no treatment is not claimable.",

      "answer": "No, because the policy limits AYUSH treatment reimbursement to government‑recognised (e.g., NABH‑approved) hospitals only, and a non‑registered AYUSH hospital—even with qualified practitioners—does not meet that condition, so the inpatient mental‑illness expenses would not be reimbursed.",
