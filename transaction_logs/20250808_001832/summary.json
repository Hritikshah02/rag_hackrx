      "answer": "Since the daughter is now married and thus ineligible for coverage under the policy, she cannot submit a dental claim, any change of her surname must be communicated in writing to the company and effected through a policy endorsement, and the grievance‑redressal email is csd@orientalinsurance.co.in.",
