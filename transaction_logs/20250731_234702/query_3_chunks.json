Supposing the centripetal force to be proportional to t/ie distance of the body from the centre ; all bodies revolving in any planes whatsoever will describe ellipses, and complete their revolutions in equal times ; and those which move in right lines, running backwards and forwards alternately ', will complete ttieir several periods of going and returning in the same times. For letting all things stand as in the foregoing Proposition, the force SV, with which the body Q, revolving in any plane PQ,R is attracted to wards the centre S, is as the distance SO. ; and therefore because SV and SQ,, TV and CQ, are proportional, the force TV with which the body is attracted towards the given point C in the plane of the orbit is as the dis tance CQ,. Therefore the forces with which bodies found in the plane PQ,R are attracted towaitis the point O, are in proportion to the distances equal to the forces with which the same bodies are attract-ed every way to wards the centre S ; and therefore the bodies will move in the same times, and in the same figures, in any plane PQR about the point C. n* they THE MATHE",

The honour of knighthood v/as conferred on our author in 1705. Soon afterward, he was a candidate again for the Repre sentation of the University, but was defeated by a large majority. It is thought that a more pliant man was preferred by both min isters and electors. Newton was always remarkable for simplicity of dress, and his only known departure from it was on this oc casion, when he is said to have appeared in a suit of laced clothes. The Algebraical Lectures which he had, Juring nine years, delivered at Cambridge, were published by Whiston, in 1707, under the title of ARITHMETICS UNIVERSALIS, SINE DE COMPOSI TIONS ET RESOLUTIONS ARITHMETICA LIBER. This publication is said to have been a breach of confidence on Whiston's part. Mr. Ralphson, not long afterward, translated the work into English ; and a second edition of it, with improvements by the author, was issued at London, 1712, by Dr. Machin. Subsequent editions, both in English and Latin, with commentaries, have been published. In June, 1709, Newton intrusted the superintendence of a second edition of the PRINCIPIA to Roger Cotes, Plumian Pro fessor of Astronomy at Cambridge. The first edition had been sold off for some time. Copies of the work had become very rare, and could only be obtained at several times their original cost. A great number of letters passed oetween the author and Mr. Cotes during the preparation of the edition, which finally appeared in May, 1713. It had many alterations and improve ments, and was accompanied by an admirable Preface from the pen of Cotes. Our author's early Treatise, entitled, ANALYSIS PER EQUATIONES NUMERO TERMINORUM INFINITAS, as well as a small Tract, Gearing the title of METHODUS DIFFERENTIALS, was published, witn nis consent, in 1711.

Of the motion of bodies that are resisted in the ratio of the velocity. PROPOSITION I. THEOREM I. Tf a body is resisted in the ratio of its velocity, the motion lost by re sistance is as the space gone over in its motion. For since the motion lost in each equal particle of time is as the velocity, that is, as the particle of space gone over, then, by composition, the motion lost in the whole time will he as the whole space gone over. Q.E.D. COR. Therefore if the body, destitute of all gravity, move by its innate force only in free spaces, and there be given both its whole motion at the beginning, and also the motion remaining after some part of the way is gone over, there will be given also the whole space which the body can de scribe in an infinite time. For that space will be to the space now de scribed as the whole motion at the beginning is to the part lost of that motion. LEMMA I.

Let the time be divided into equal particles ; and if at the very beginning of each particle we suppose the resistance to act with one single impulse which is as the velocity, the decrement of the velocity in each of THE MATHEMATICAL PRINCIPLES [BOOK II. the particles of time will be as the same velocity.

From this ratio the length DF is to be collected by calculation ; and a length, which is to the assumed length DP as the length DF known by experiment to the length DF just now found, will be the true length DP. This being known, you will have both the curve line DraF which the body describes, and also the velocity and resistance of the body in each place. SCHOLIUM.

OF NATURAL PHILOSOPHY. AXIOMS, OR LAWS OF MOTION. LAW I. Hvery body perseveres in its state of rest, or of uniform motion in a ri^ht line, unless it is compelled to change that state by forces impressed thereon. PROJECTILES persevere in their motions, so far as they are not retarded by the resistance of the air, or impelled downwards by the force of gravity A top, whose parts by their cohesion are perpetually drawn aside from rectilinear motions, does not cease its rotation, otherwise than as it is re tarded by the air. The greater bodies of the planets and comets, meeting with less resistance in more free spaces, preserve then jDotions both pro gressive and circular for a much longer time. LAW II. The alteration of motion is ever proportional to the motive force imp reus ed ; and is made in the direction of the right line in. which that force is impressed. If any force generates a motion, a double force will generate double the motion, a triple force triple the motion, whether that force be impressed altogether and at once, or gradually and successively. And this motion (being always directed the same way with the generating force), if the body moved before, is added to or subducted from the former motion, according as they directly conspire with or are directly contrary to each other ; or obliquely joined, when they are oblique, so as to produce a new motion compounded from the determination of both.
