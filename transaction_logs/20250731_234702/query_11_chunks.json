He had been privy counsellor to the Elector of Han over, before that prince was elevated to the British throne ; and in his correspondence, in 1715 and 1716, with the Abbe Conti, then at the court of George L, and with Caroline, Princess of Wales, he attacked the doctrines of the PRINCIPIA, and indirectly its author, in a manner very discreditable to himself, both as a learned and as an honourable man.

The history of these problems affords, by direct comparison, a striking illustration of Newton's vast superiority of mind. That amazing concentration and grasp of intellect, of which we have spoken, enabled him to master speedily, and, as it were, by a single effort, those things, for the achievement of which, the many would essay utterly in vain, and the very, very few attain only after long and renewed striving.

It contained a history of the whole matter, and a triumphant reply to the objections of M. Freret. This answer called into the field a fresh antagonist, Father Soueiet, whose five dissertations on this subject were chiefly remarkable for the want of knowledge and want of decorum, which they displayed. In consequence of these discussions, Newton was in duced to prepare his larger work for the press, and had nearly completed it at the time of his death. It was published in 1728, under the title of THE CHRONOLOGY OF THE ANCIENT KINGDOMS AMENDED, TO WHICH is PREFIXED A SHORT CHRONICLE FROM THE FIRST MEMORY OF THINGS IN EUROPE TO THE CONQUEST OF PERSIA BY ALEXANDER THE GREAT. It consists of six chap ters: 1. On the Chronology of the Greeks; according to Whis- ton, our author wrote out eighteen copies of this chapter with his own hand, differing little from one another. 2. Of the Empire of Egypt; 3. Of the Assyrian Empire; 4. Of the two contempo rary Empires of the Babylonians and Medes ; 5. A Description of the Temple of Solomon ; 6. Of the Empire of the Persians ; this chapter was not found copied with the other five, but as it was discovered among his papers, arid appeared to be a continu ation of the same work, the Editor thought proper to add it thereto.

It is thought that a more pliant man was preferred by both min isters and electors. Newton was always remarkable for simplicity of dress, and his only known departure from it was on this oc casion, when he is said to have appeared in a suit of laced clothes. The Algebraical Lectures which he had, Juring nine years, delivered at Cambridge, were published by Whiston, in 1707, under the title of ARITHMETICS UNIVERSALIS, SINE DE COMPOSI TIONS ET RESOLUTIONS ARITHMETICA LIBER. This publication is said to have been a breach of confidence on Whiston's part. Mr. Ralphson, not long afterward, translated the work into English ; and a second edition of it, with improvements by the author, was issued at London, 1712, by Dr. Machin. Subsequent editions, both in English and Latin, with commentaries, have been published. In June, 1709, Newton intrusted the superintendence of a second edition of the PRINCIPIA to Roger Cotes, Plumian Pro fessor of Astronomy at Cambridge. The first edition had been sold off for some time. Copies of the work had become very rare, and could only be obtained at several times their original cost. A great number of letters passed oetween the author and Mr. Cotes during the preparation of the edition, which finally appeared in May, 1713. It had many alterations and improve ments, and was accompanied by an admirable Preface from the pen of Cotes.

He did not often join his classmates in play ; but he would contrive for them various amusements of a scientific kind. Paper kites he introduced ; carefully determining their best form and proportions, and the position and number of points whereby to attach the string. He also invented paper lanterns ; these served ordinarily to guide the way to school in winter mornings, but occasionally for quite another purpose ; they were attached to the tails of kites in a dark night, to the dismay of the country people dreading portentous comets, and to the immeasureable delight ol his companions. To him, however, young as he was, life seemed to have become an earnest thing. When not occupied with his studies, his mind would be engrossed with mechanical contrivances ; now imitating, now inventing. He became singularly skilful in the use of his little saws, hatchets, hammers, and other tools. A windmill was erected near Grantham ; during the operations ol the workmen, he was frequently present ; in a short time, he had completed a perfect working model of it, which elicited general admiration. Not content, however, with this exact imitation, he conceived the idea of employing, in the place of sails, animal power , and, adapting the construction of his mill accordingly, he enclosed in it a mouse, called the miller, and which by acting on a sort ot treadvvheel, gave motion to the machine. He invented, too, a mechanical carriage — having four wheels, and put in motion with a handle worked by the person sitting inside. The measurement of time early drew his attention. He h'rst constructed a water clock, in proportions somewhat like an old-fashioned house clock. The index of the dial plate was",

In forming this conclusion, he supposed the planets to move in perfect circles, concentric to the sun. Now was this the law of the moon's motion ? Was such a force, em anating from the earth and directed to the moon, sufficient, when diminished as the square of the distance, to retain her in her orbit ? To ascertain this master-fact, he compared the space through which heavy bodies fall, in a second of time, at a given distance from the centre of the earth, namely, at its surface, with the space through which the moon falls, as it were, to the earth, in the same time, while revolving in a circular orbit. He was absent from books ; and, therefore, adopted, in computing the earth's diameter, the common estimate of sixty miles to a degree of latitude as then in use among geographers and navigators. The result of his calculations did not, ot course, answer his ex pectations ; hence, he concluded that some other cause, beyond the reach of observation — analogous, perhaps, to the vortices of Des cartes — joined its action to that of the power of gravity upon the rnooil. Though by no means satisfied, he yet abandoned awhile further inquiry, and remained totally silent upon the subject. These rapid marches in the career of discovery, combined with the youth of Newton, seem to evince a penetration the most lively, and an invention the most exuberant. But in him there was a conjunction of influences as extraordinary as fortunate. Study, unbroken, persevering and profound carried on its inform ing and disciplining work upon a genius, natively the greatest, and rendered freest in its movements, and clearest in its vision, through the untrammelling and enlig} tenirig power of religion.
