Some astronomers affirm that there is no such motion; others reckon it no greater than what may easily arise from the causes hereafter to be assigned, and is of no mo« ment in the present question. THE SYSTEM 01 THE WORLD. 521 We may even neglect the motion of the moon's apsis (p. 390, 391), which is far greater than in the circum-solar planets, amounting in every revolu tion to three degrees ; and from this motion it is demonstrable that the circum-terrestrial force decreases in no less than the duplicate, but far less than the triplicate proportion of the distance ; for if the duplicate propor tion was gradually changed into the triplicate, the motion of the apsis would thereby increase to infinity; and, therefore, by a very small muta tion, would exceed the motion of the moon's apsis. This slow motion arises from the action of the circum-solar force, as we shall afterwards explain. But, secluding this cause, the apsis or apogeon of the moon will be fixed, and the duplicate proportion of the decrease of the circum-terrestrial force in different distances from the earth will accurately take place. Now that this proportion has been established, we may compare the forces of the several planets among themselves (p. 391). In the mean distance of Jupiter from the earth, the greatest elongation of the outmost satellite from Jupiter's centre (by the observations of Mr. Flamsted] is 8' 13\" ; and therefore the distance of the satellite from the centre of Jupiter is to the mean distance of Jupiter from tne centre of the sun as 124 to 52012, but to the mean distance of Venus from the centre of the sun as 124 to 7234; and their periodic times are 16£d. and 224fd ; and from hence (according to Cor. II, Prop. IV), dividing the distances by the squares of the times, we infer that the force by which the satellite is impelled towards Jupiter is to the force by which Venus is impelled to wards the sun as 442 to 143 ; and if we diminish the force by which the satellite is impelled in the duplicate proportion of the distance 124 to 7234, we shall have the circum-jovial force in the distance of Venus from the sun to the circum-solar force by which Venus is",

The moon moves slower in the dilated and faster in the contracted orbit ; and the annual equation, by which this inequality is regulated, vanishes in the apogee and perigee of the sun. In the mean distance of the sun from the earth it arises to about 11' 50\" ; in other distances of the sun it is pro portional to the equation of the sun's centre, and is added to the mean motion of the moon, while the earth is passing .from its aphelion to its perihelion, and subducted while the earth is in the opposite semi-circle.
