DEFINITION VIII. TJie motive quantity of a centripetal force, is the measure of the samt\\ proportional to the motion which it generates in a given twip. Thus the weight is greater in a greater body, less in a less body ; and. in the same body, it is greater near to the earth, and less at remoter dis tances. This sort of quantity is the centripetency, or propension of the whole body towards the centre, or, as I may say, its weight ; and it is al ways known by the quantity of an equal and contrary force just sufficient to Ifinder the descent of the body. These quantities of forces, we may, for brevity's sake, call by the names of motive, accelerative, and absolute forces ; and, for distinction's sake, con sider them, with respect to the bodies that tend to the centre ; to the places of those bodies ; and to the centre of force towards which they tend ; that is to say, I refer the motive force to the body as an endeavour and propen sity of the whole towards a centre, arising from the propensities of the several parts taken together ; the accelerative force to the place of the body, as a certain power or energy diffused from the centre to all places around to move the bodies that are in them : and the absolute force to the centre, as endued with some cause, without which those motive forces would not be propagated through the spaces round about ; whether that cause be some central body (siuh as is the load-stone, in the centre of the magnetic force, or the earth in the centre of the gravitating force), or anything else that does not yet appear. For I here design only to give a mathematical notion of those forces, without considering their physical causes and seats. Wherefore the accelerative force will stand in the same relation to the motive, as celerity does to motion. For the quantity of motion arises from the celerity drawn into the quantity of matter : and the motive force arises from the accelerative force drawn into the same quantity of matter.

In forming this conclusion, he supposed the planets to move in perfect circles, concentric to the sun. Now was this the law of the moon's motion ? Was such a force, em anating from the earth and directed to the moon, sufficient, when diminished as the square of the distance, to retain her in her orbit ? To ascertain this master-fact, he compared the space through which heavy bodies fall, in a second of time, at a given distance from the centre of the earth, namely, at its surface, with the space through which the moon falls, as it were, to the earth, in the same time, while revolving in a circular orbit. He was absent from books ; and, therefore, adopted, in computing the earth's diameter, the common estimate of sixty miles to a degree of latitude as then in use among geographers and navigators. The result of his calculations did not, ot course, answer his ex pectations ; hence, he concluded that some other cause, beyond the reach of observation — analogous, perhaps, to the vortices of Des cartes — joined its action to that of the power of gravity upon the rnooil. Though by no means satisfied, he yet abandoned awhile further inquiry, and remained totally silent upon the subject. These rapid marches in the career of discovery, combined with the youth of Newton, seem to evince a penetration the most lively, and an invention the most exuberant. But in him there was a conjunction of influences as extraordinary as fortunate.

This being known, you will have both the curve line DraF which the body describes, and also the velocity and resistance of the body in each place. SCHOLIUM. But, yet, that the resistance of bodies is in the ratio of the velocity, is more a mathematical hypothesis than a physical one.

Let us, therefore, see what motions arise from this law of resistance. SECTION II. 'If the motion of bodies that are resisted in tfie duplicate ratio of their velocities. PROPOSITION V. THEOREM III. Ff a body is resisted in the duplicate ratio of its velocity, and moves by its innate force only through a similar medium; and the times be taken in a geometrical progression, proceeding from less to greater terms : I say, that the velocities at the beginning of each of the times are in the same geometrical progression inversely ; and that the spaces are equal, which are described in each of the times. For since the resistance of the medium is proportional to the square of the velocity, and the decrement of the velocity is proportional to the resist ance : if the time be divided into innumerable equal particles, the squares of the velocities at the beginning of each of the times will be proportional to the differences of the same velocities. Let those particles of time be AK, KL, LM, &c., taken in the right line CD; and erect the perpendiculars AB, Kk, L/, Mm, &c., meeting the hyperbola BklmG, described with the centre C, and the rectangular asymptotes CD, CH. in B, kj I, m, (fee. ; then AB will be to K",

Wherefore the accelerative force will stand in the same relation to the motive, as celerity does to motion. For the quantity of motion arises from the celerity drawn into the quantity of matter : and the motive force arises from the accelerative force drawn into the same quantity of matter.

Hence it is, that near the OF NATURAL PHILOSOPHY. 77 surface of the earth, where the accelerative gravity, or force productive of gravity, in all bodies is the same, the motive gravity or the weight is as the body : but if we should ascend to higher regions, where the accelerative gravity is less, the weight would be equally diminished, and would always be as the product of the body, by the accelerative gravity. So in those re gions, where the accelerative gravity is diminished into one half, the weight of a body two or three times less, will be four or six times less. I likewise call attractions and impulses, in the same sense, accelerative, and motive ; and use the words attraction, impulse or propensity of any sort towards a centre, promiscuously, and indifferently, one for another ; considering those forces not physically, but mathematically : wherefore, the reader is not to imagine, that by those words, I anywhere take upon me to define the kind, or the manner of any action, the causes or the physical reason thereof, or that I attribute forces, in a true and physical sense, to certain centres (which are only mathematical points) ; when at any time I happen to speak of centres as attracting, or as endued with attractive powers.

I do not define time, space, place and motion, as being well known to all. Only I must observe, that the vulgar conceive those quantities under no other notions but from the relation they bear to sensible objects.
