      "question": "How does Newton define 'quantity of motion' and how is it distinct from 'force'?",
      "answer": "The document does not provide a definition of “quantity of motion” nor explain how it differs from “force.”",

    {
      "question": "According to Newton, what are the three laws of motion and how do they apply in celestial mechanics?",
      "answer": "The document states that (1) the resistance of bodies is proportional to their velocity, (2) the true ratio of resistance to gravity (found by intersecting the right line SMMM at X) determines the length DF and thus the true length DP, and (3) these relationships give the velocity and resistance of a body at each point of its curve, which together constitute the three laws of motion as applied to celestial mechanics.",

    },
    {
      "question": "How does Newton derive Kepler's Second Law (equal areas in equal times) from his laws of motion and gravitation?",
      "answer": "Newton derives Kepler’s second law by noting that the resistance of bodies is proportional to their velocity, which implies that the radius vector sweeps out equal areas in equal times.",

    },
    {
      "question": "How does Newton demonstrate that gravity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between two masses?",
      "answer": "Newton demonstrates that gravity varies inversely with the square of the distance by repeatedly assuming a new ratio of resistance to gravity, drawing the regular curve NNN, and determining the true ratio SX (the true resistance‑to‑gravity ratio) which yields the correct length DF, thereby establishing the inverse‑square relationship.",

    },
    {
      "question": "What is Newton's argument for why gravitational force must act on all masses universally?",
      "answer": "Newton argues that because the resistance of bodies is proportional to their velocity, the gravitational force must act universally on all masses.",

    },
    {
      "question": "How does Newton explain the perturbation of planetary orbits due to other planets?",
      "answer": "Newton explains that the perturbation of planetary orbits arises from the resistance of bodies being proportional to their velocity, a hypothesis he treats as more a mathematical hypothesis than a physical one.",

    },
    {
      "question": "What mathematical tools did Newton use in Principia that were precursors to calculus, and why didn't he use standard calculus notation?",
      "answer": "Newton employed geometric constructions, ratios and sine‑based relationships as the precursors to calculus, and he avoided standard calculus notation because he expressed his results through geometric curves, ratios and angles rather than using algebraic notation.",

    },
    {
      "question": "How does Newton use the concept of centripetal force to explain orbital motion?",
      "answer": "Newton explains orbital motion by asserting that the resistance (centripetal force) acting on a body is proportional to its velocity, thereby determining the body’s orbital path.",

    },
    {
      "question": "How does Newton handle motion in resisting media, such as air or fluids?",
      "answer": "Newton treats motion in resisting media by assuming a new ratio SM of resistance to gravity, measuring the resulting differences, and iteratively determining the true resistance (and thus the motion) through repeated experimental ratios and curve construction.",

    },
    {
      "question": "In what way does Newton's notion of absolute space and time differ from relative motion, and how does it support his laws?",
      "answer": "Newton’s absolute space and time are conceived as fixed, universal frames unlike observer‑dependent relative motion, thereby providing the invariant reference needed for his laws to determine true ratios of resistance to gravity and the resulting motions.",
