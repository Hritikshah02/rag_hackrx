      "question": "How does Newton define 'quantity of motion' and how is it distinct from 'force'?",
      "answer": "Newton defines quantity of motion as the product of a body’s mass and its velocity, whereas force is the cause that changes (or accelerates) that quantity of motion.",

    {
      "question": "According to Newton, what are the three laws of motion and how do they apply in celestial mechanics?",
      "answer": "The document does not contain Newton’s three laws of motion, and therefore it provides no description of how such laws would apply in celestial mechanics.",

    },
    {
      "question": "How does Newton derive Kepler's Second Law (equal areas in equal times) from his laws of motion and gravitation?",
      "answer": "Newton shows that because gravity acts as a central force, the angular momentum of a planet about the Sun is conserved, which makes the radius vector sweep out equal areas in equal times.",

      "index": 2,
      "success": true
    },
    {
      "question": "How does Newton demonstrate that gravity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between two masses?",
      "answer": "Newton demonstrates the inverse‑square relationship by repeatedly determining the true ratio of resistance to gravity (SX) from measured lengths (DF and DP) and using this ratio to calculate the gravitational effect, thereby establishing that gravity varies inversely with the square of the distance between the masses.",

      "success": true
    },
    {
      "question": "What is Newton's argument for why gravitational force must act on all masses universally?",
      "answer": "Newton argues that because the resistance of bodies is proportional to their velocity, the gravitational force must act universally on all masses.",

    },
    {
      "question": "How does Newton explain the perturbation of planetary orbits due to other planets?",
      "answer": "Newton explains that the perturbation of planetary orbits is caused by the resistance of other bodies, which changes the ratio of resistance to gravity and therefore alters the orbital curve.",

    },
    {
      "question": "What mathematical tools did Newton use in Principia that were precursors to calculus, and why didn't he use standard calculus notation?",
      "answer": "Newton employed geometric constructions, ratios and sine‑based area calculations as precursors to calculus, and he avoided standard calculus notation because his work relied on geometric and ratio methods rather than symbolic calculus.",

      "success": true
    },
    {
      "question": "How does Newton use the concept of centripetal force to explain orbital motion?",
      "answer": "Newton explains orbital motion by equating the resistance (centripetal force) to the velocity of the body, using the ratio of resistance to gravity to determine the true path and velocity of the body.",

    },
    {
      "question": "How does Newton handle motion in resisting media, such as air or fluids?",
      "answer": "Newton handles motion in resisting media by repeatedly assuming a new resistance‑to‑gravity ratio, measuring the resulting differences, constructing a regular curve through the points N, and using its intersection with the right line to determine the true resistance ratio, from which the true length and thus the curve of motion, velocity, and resistance at each point are obtained.",

    },
    {
      "question": "In what way does Newton's notion of absolute space and time differ from relative motion, and how does it support his laws?",
      "answer": "Newton’s absolute space and time provide a fixed, true reference (the “true ratio” and “true length”) that remains constant while relative motion varies, thereby giving a consistent framework on which his laws can be applied.",
