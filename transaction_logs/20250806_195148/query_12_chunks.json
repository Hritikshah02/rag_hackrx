The  conjecture       appeared most      proba\nble : and, in order to     estimate what the        degree   of diminution\nmight   be, he considered  that if the moon      be retained in her    orbit\nby the force of gravity,   the primary planets        must also be carried\nround    the sun by the like power;     and, by comparing    the periods\nof the   several planets  with their distances   from   the sun, he found\nthat, if they were  held   in their courses  by any power    like gravity,\nits strength must   decrease   in the duplicate     proportion of the   in\ncrease   of distance.
