      "answer": "The claim is admissible because the child qualifies as a dependent (under 26, unmarried and unemployed) and dental surgery is covered as a surgical procedure, so the claim may be made under the policy’s normal claim process as prescribed in Clause VI.3/VI.4.",

What is the claim eligibility for the newborn's treatment expenses, referencing definitions, exclusions, and newborn cover terms?",
      "answer": "Since the policy defines a “New Born Baby” as a child born during the policy period and aged up to 90 days, the newborn’s treatment expenses are claim‑eligible under the newborn cover provided the condition is not one of the excluded ailments listed (e.g., asthma, diabetes, etc.), which it is not.",

      "answer": "No, because the policy requires that the treatment be prescribed by a “medical practitioner” (as defined in the policy) and the policy does not list a registered Clinical Psychologist as an eligible practitioner, so a GP prescription plus a psychologist‑certified discharge summary does not meet the documented practitioner‑eligibility requirement.",
