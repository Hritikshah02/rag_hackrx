For the resistance of projectiles moving with exceedingly great celerities is not much diminished by the subtilty of the medium. COR. G. All these things are so in fluids whose elastic force takes its rise from the centrifugal forces of the particles. But if that force arise from some other cause, as from the expansion of the particles after the manner of wool, or the boughs of trees, or any other cause, by which the particles are hindered from moving freely among themselves, the resistance, by reason of the lesser fluidity of the medium, will be greater than in the Corollaries above.

If iu a rare medium, consisting of equal particles freely disposed at equal distances from each other, a globe and a cylinder described on equal diameters move with equal velocities in the. direction of the axis of the cylinder, the resistance of the globe ivill be but half so great an that of the cylinder. For since the action of the medi um upon the body is the same (by Cor. 5 of the Laws) whether the body move in a quiescent medium, or whether the particles of the medium impinge with the same velocity upon the quiescent body, let us consider the body as if it were quiescent, and see with what force it would be im- pelled by the moving medium. Let, therefore, ABKI represent a spherical body described from the centre C with the semi-diameter CA, and let the particles of the medium impinge with a given velocity upon that spherical body in the directions of right lines parallel to AC : and let FB be one of those right lines. In FB take LB equal to the semi-diameter CB, and draw BI) touching the sphere in B. Upon KG and BD let fall the per pendiculars BE, LD ; and the force with which a particle of the medium, impinging on the globe obliquely in the direction FB, would strike the globe in B, will be to the force with which the same particle, meeting the cylinder ONGQ, described about the globe with the axis ACI, would strike it perpendicularly in b, as",

But it is suf ficient to have cleared the way to this speculation in Prop. VIII and IX foregoing, and their Corollaries. For in those Propositions, instead of the uniform resistance made to an ascending body arising from its gravity, one may substitute the uniform resistance which arises from the tenacity of the medium, when the body moves by its vis insita alone ; and when the body ascends in a right line, add this uniform resistance to the force of gravity, and subduct it when the body descends in a right line. One might also go on to the motion of bodies which are resisted in part uni formly, in part in the ratio of the velocity, and in part in the duplicate ratio of the same velocity. And I have opened a way to this in Prop. XIII and XIV foregoing, in which the uniform resistance arising from the tenacity of the medium may be substituted for the force of gravity, or be compounded with it as before.

And the forces of the reflexions are as the velocities and the magnitudes and the densities of the corresponding parts conjunctly ; that is, as the ve locities and the cubes of the diameters and the densities of the parts.

Therefore if those systems are two elastic fluids, like our air, and their parts are at rest among themselves ; and two similar bodies pro portional in magnitude and density to the parts of the fluids, and similarly gituated among those parts, be any how projected in the direction of lines similarly posited ; and the accelerative forces with which the particles of the fluids mutually act upon each other are as the diameters of the bodies projected inversely and the squares of their velocities directly ; those bodies will excite similar motions in the fluids in proportional times, and will de scribe similar spaces and proportional to their diameters. COR. 2. Therefore in the same fluid a projected body that moves swiftly meets with a resistance that is, in the duplicate ratio of its velocity, nearly. For if the forces with which distant particles act mutually upon one another should be augmented in the duplicate ratio of the velocity, the projected body would be resisted in the same duplicate ratio accurately ; and therefore in a medium, whose parts when at a distance do not act mu tually with any force on one another, the resistance is in the duplicate ra tio of the velocity accurately. Let there be, therefore, three mediums A, B, C, consisting of similar and equal parts regularly disposed at equal distances. Let the parts of the mediums A and B recede from each",

SEC. VII.] OF NATURAL PHILOSOPHY. 331 SCHOLIUM. I have exhibited in this Proposition the resistance and retardation of spherical projectiles in mediums that are not continued, and shewn that this resistance is to the force by which the whole motion of the globe may be destroyed or produced in the time in which the globe can describe two thirds of its diameter, with a velocity uniformly continued, as the density of the medium to the density of the globe, if so be the globe and the particles of the medium be perfectly elastic, and are endued with the utmost force of reflexion ; and that this force, where the globe and particles of the medium are infinitely hard and void of any reflecting force, is diminished one half. But in continued mediums, as water, hot oil, and quicksilver, the globe as it passes through them does not immediately strike against all the parti cles of the fluid that generate the resistance made to it, but presses only the particles that lie next to it, which press the particles beyond, which press other particles, and so on ; and in these mediums the resistance is di minished one other half. A globe in these extremely fluid mediums meets with a resistance that is to the force by which its whole motion may be destroyed or generated in the time wherein it can describe, with that mo tion uniformly continued, eight third parts of its diameter, as the density of the medium to the density of the globe. This I shall endeavour to shew in what follows. PROPOSITION XXXVI. PROBLEM VIII. To define the motion of water running out of a cylindrical vessel through a hole made at the bottom.

Now if that water becomes fluid, it will somewhat increase the resistance. But in these Propositions that increase is so small, that it may be neglected, because the convex superfi cies of the globe produces the very same effect almost as the congelation of the water.

F a space which is to f D as the den sity of the globe to the density of the medium, that is, as A to A — B, G the time in which the globe falling with the weight B without resistance describes the space P, and H the velocity which the body acquires by that fall.

That resistance which arises from the elasticity, tenacity, and friction of its parts, may be thus investigated.

PROPOSITION LI. THEOREM XXXIX. If a solid cylinder infinitely long, in an uniform and infinite fluid, revolve with an uniform motion about an axis given in position, and the fluid be forced round by only this impulse of the cylinder, and every part of the fluid persevere uniformly in its 'motion ; I say, that the periodic times of the parts of the fluid are as their distances Jrom the axis of the cylinder. Let AFL be a cylinder turning uni formly about the axis S, arid let the concentric circles BGM, CHN, DIO, EKP, &c., divide the fluid into innu merable concentric cylindric solid orbs of the same thickness. Then, because the fluid is homogeneous, the impres sions which the contiguous orbs make upon each other mutually will be (by the Hypothesis) as their translations from each, other, and as the contiguous superficies upon which the impressions are made. If the impression made upon any orb be greater or less on its concave than on its convex side, the stronger impression will prevail, and will either accelerate or retard the motion of the orb, according as it agrees with, or is contrary to, the motion of the same. Therefore, that every orb may persevere uniformly in its motion, the impressions made on both sides must be equal and their directions contrary. Therefore since the impres sions are as the contiguous superficies, and as their translations from one another, the translations will be inversely as the superficies, that is, inversely as the distances of the superficies from the axis. But the differences of SEC.

A fluid is any body whose parts yield to any force impressed on it, by yielding, are easily moved among themselves. PROPOSITION XIX. THEOREM XIv All the parts of a homogeneous and unmoved fluid included in any un moved vessel, and compressed on every side (setting aside the consider ation of condensation, gravity, and all centripetal forces], will be equally pressed on every side, and remain in their places without any motion arising from that pressure. CASE 1. Let a fluid be included in the spherical vessel ABC, and uniformly compressed on every side : 1 say, that no part of it will be moved by that pressure. For if any part, as L), be moved, all such parts at the same distance from the centre on every side must necessarily be moved at the same time by a like motion ; because the pressure of them all is similar and equal ; and all other motion is excluded that does not arise from that pressure. But if these parts come all of them nearer to the centre, the fluid must be condensed towards the centre, contrary to the supposition. If they recede from it, the fluid must be condensed towards the circumfer ence ; which is also contrary to the supposition. Neither can they move in any one direction retaining their distance from the centre, because for the same reason, they may move in a contrary direction :",

But let us return to more simple curves. Because there can be no motion in a para bola except in a non-resisting medium, but in the hyperbolas here described it is produced by a perpetual resistance ; it is evident that the line which a projectile describes in an uniformly resisting medium approaches nearer to these hyperbolas than to a parabola. That line is certainly of the hyperbolic kind, but about the vertex it is more distant from the asymptotes, and in the parts remote from the vertex draws nearer to them than these hy- M JL BD K perbolas here described. The difference, however, is not so great between the one and the other but that these latter may be commod^ously enough used in practice instead of the former. And perhaps these may prove more useful than an hyperbola that is more accurate, and at the same time more compounded. They may be made use of, then, in this manner.
