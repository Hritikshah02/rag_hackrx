      "question": "How does Newton define 'quantity of motion' and how is it distinct from 'force'?",
      "answer": "Newton defines the quantity of motion as the product of velocity and quantity of matter, distinct from force which is an action to change a body's state.",
      "retrieved_chunks_file": "transaction_logs/20250801_125508/query_1_chunks.json"

    {
      "question": "According to Newton, what are the three laws of motion and how do they apply in celestial mechanics?",
      "answer": "Information not found in the document.",

    },
    {
      "question": "How does Newton derive Kepler's Second Law (equal areas in equal times) from his laws of motion and gravitation?",
      "answer": "Newton derives Kepler's Second Law by demonstrating that a centripetal force, acting continuously to draw a body away from the tangent of its path, results in the continuous description of equal areas in equal times.",

    {
      "question": "How does Newton demonstrate that gravity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between two masses?",
      "answer": "Information not found in the document.",

    },
    {
      "question": "What is Newton's argument for why gravitational force must act on all masses universally?",
      "answer": "Newton's argument is that because gravity acts on all bodies on Earth in the same manner, and the nature of gravity towards planets is the same as towards Earth, it must act universally on all masses.",
      "retrieved_chunks_file": "transaction_logs/20250801_125508/query_5_chunks.json"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does Newton explain the perturbation of planetary orbits due to other planets?",
      "answer": "Newton explains that perturbations in planetary orbits are caused by the mutual attractions between celestial bodies, where the forces tend towards the centers of these bodies and decrease in proportion to the square of the distance.",
      "retrieved_chunks_file": "transaction_logs/20250801_125508/query_6_chunks.json"
    },
    {
      "question": "What mathematical tools did Newton use in Principia that were precursors to calculus, and why didn't he use standard calculus notation?",
      "answer": "Newton utilized geometrical synthesis, which he considered superior to algebraic methods, and did not employ standard calculus notation due to his preference for the geometrical approach and his inventor status of the method.",
      "retrieved_chunks_file": "transaction_logs/20250801_125508/query_7_chunks.json"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does Newton use the concept of centripetal force to explain orbital motion?",
      "answer": "Newton explains orbital motion by demonstrating how a centripetal force, directed towards a central body, can deflect a projectile from its natural straight path, causing it to curve into an orbit.",
      "retrieved_chunks_file": "transaction_logs/20250801_125508/query_8_chunks.json"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does Newton handle motion in resisting media, such as air or fluids?",
      "answer": "Newton describes resistance in fluids as proportional to velocity and its square, depending on the medium's properties like fluidity, tenacity, and the density and elasticity of its parts.",
      "retrieved_chunks_file": "transaction_logs/20250801_125508/query_9_chunks.json"
    },
    {
      "question": "In what way does Newton's notion of absolute space and time differ from relative motion, and how does it support his laws?",
      "answer": "Newton's absolute space and time are immutable frameworks that allow true motion to be determined by forces and their effects, unlike relative motion which is dependent on external bodies and their perceived states of rest or movement, thus providing a basis for universally applicable laws of motion.",

      "question": "Who was the grandfather of Isaac Newton?",
      "answer": "The grandfather of Isaac Newton was Robert Newton.",

    },
    {
      "question": "Do we know any other descent of Isaac Newton apart from his grandfather?",
      "answer": "Beyond his grandfather, Robert Newton, the descent of Sir Isaac cannot be traced with certainty.",
