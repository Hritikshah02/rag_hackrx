COR. 2. But the perturbation will be greatest of all, if we suppose the uccelerative attractions of the parts of the system towards the greatest body of all are not to each other reciprocally as the squares of the distances from that great body ; especially if the inequality of this proportion be greater than the inequality of the proportion of the distances from the great body. For if the accelerative force, acting in parallel directions and equally, causes no perturbation in the motions of the parts of the system, it must of course, when it acts unequally, cause a perturbation some where, which will be greater or less as the inequality is greater or less. The excess of the greater impulses acting upon some bodies, and not acting upon others, must necessarily change their situation among themselves. And this perturbation, added to the perturbation arising from the inequality and inclination of the lines, makes the whole perturbation greater. COR. '*. Hence if the parts of this system move in ellipses or circles without any remarkable perturbation, it is manifest that, if they are at all impelled by accelerative forces tending to any other bodies, the impulse is very weak, or else is impressed very near equally and in parallel directions upon all of them. PROPOSITION LXVL THEOREM XXVI. Tf three bodies whose forces decrease in a duplicate ratio of the distances attract each other mutually ; and the accelerative attractions of any two towards the third be between themselves reciprocally as the squares, of the distances ; and the two least revolve about the greatest ; I say, that the interior of the tivo revolving bodies will, by radii drawn to the innermost and greatest, describe round thai body areas more propor tional to the times, and a figure more approaching to that of an ellip sis having its focus in the point of concourse of the radii, if that great body be agitated by those attractions, than it would do if lhat great body were not attracted at all by the lesser, but remained at rest ; or than it would if that great body were very much more or very much less attracted",

    "text": "our author inferred that the force which retained the planet in its orbit was always directed to the sun ; and from the second, namely, that every planet moves in an ellipse with the sun in one of its foci, he drew the more general inference that the force by which the planet moves round that focus varies inversely as the square of its dis tance therefrom : and he demonstrated that a planet acted upon by such a force could not move in any other curve than a conic section ; showing when the moving body would describe a circu lar, an elliptical, a parabolic, or hyperbolic orbit. He demon strated, too, that this force, or attracting, gravitating power re sided in every, the least particle ; but that, in spherical masses, it operated as if confined to their centres ; so that, one sphere or body will act upon another sphere or body, with a force directly proportional to the quantity of matter, and inversely as the square of the distance between their centres; and that their velocities of mutual approach will be in the inverse ratio of their quantities o*' matter. Thus he grandly outlined the Universal Law. Verify ing its truth by the motions of terrestrial bodies, then by those of the moon and other secondary orbs, he finally embraced, in one mighty generalization, the entire Solar System — all the move ments of all its bodies — planets, satellites and comets — explain ing and harmonizing the many diverse and theretofore inexplica ble phenomena.

VI of the Laws of Motion) no change would happen in the situation of the planets one to another, nor any sensible eifect follow : but our business is with the causes of sensible effects. Let us, therefore, neglect every such force as imaginary and precarious, and of no use in the phenomena of the heavens ; and the whole remaining force by which Jupiter is impelled will be directed (by Prop. Ill, Cor. I) to the centre of the sun. The distances of the planets from the sun come out the same, whether, with Tycho, we place the earth in the centre of the system, or the sun with Copernicus : and we have already proved that these distances are true ir. Jupiter. Kepler and Bullialdiis have, with great care (p. 388), determined the listances of the planets from the sun ; and hence it is that their table.-?

And in all the planets, in Jupiter and Mars, in Saturn and the earth, as well as in Venus and Mercury, the cubes of their distances are as the squares of their periodic times ; and therefore (by Cor. VI, Prop. IV) the centripetal circum-solar force throughout all the plane tary regions decreases in the duplicate proportion of the distances from the sun. In examining this proportion, we are to use the mean distances, or the transverse semi-axes of the orbits (by Prop. XV). arid to neglect those little fractions, which, in denning the orbits, may have arisen from the in sensible errors of observation, or may be ascribed to other causes which we shall afterwards explain. And thus we shall always find the said propor tion to hold exactly; for the distances of Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, the Earth, Venus, and Mercury, from the sun, drawn from the observations of as tronomers, are, according to the computation of Kepler, as the numbers 95 LOGO, 519650, 152350, 100000, 72400, 3S806; by the computation of /iHllialdus, as the numbers 95419S, 522520, 152350, 100000, 72393, 38585 ; and from the periodic times they come out 953806, 520116, 152399, 100000,",

But that the earth and moon are equally attracted towards the sun, we have above proved ; we have likewise before proved that all bodies are subject to 530 THE SYSTEM OF THE WORLD. the said common laws of attraction. Nay, supposing any of those bodies to be deprived of its circular motion about the sun, by having its distance from the sun, we may find (by Prop. XXXVI) in what space of time it would in its descent arrive at the sun ; to wit, in half that periodic time in .vhich the body might be revolved at one half of its former distance; or in a space of time that is to the periodic time of the planet as 1 to 4</2; as that Venus in its descent would arrive at the sun in the space of 40 days, Jupiter in the space of two years and one month, and the earth and moon together in the space of 66 days and 19 hours. But, since no such thing happens, it must needs be, that those bodies are moved towards other parts (p. 75), nor is every motion sufficient for this purpose. To hinder such a descent, a due proportion of velocity is required. And hence depends the force of the argument drawn from the retardation of the motions of the planets. Unless the circum-solar force decreased in the duplicate ratio of their increasing slowness, the excess thereof would force those bodies to de scend to the sun ; for instance, if the motion (c&teris paribns) was retarded by one half, the planet would be retained in its orb by one fourth of the former circum-solar force, and by the excess of the other three fourths would descend to the sun. And therefore the planets (Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Venus, and Mercury) are not really retarded in their perigees, nor become really stationary, or regressive with slow motions. All these are but apparent, and the absolute motions, by which the planets continue to revolve in their orbits, are always direct, and nearly equable. But that such motions are performed about the sun,",

And thence, also, if the magnitude of the bodv S be proportional to its absolute force, those forces NM, ML, and their effects, will be directly as the cube of the apparent diameter of the distant body S viewed from T, and so vice versa.

And because if the orbits ESE and PAB, retaining their fig ure, proportions, and inclination to each other, should alter their magni tude ; arid the forces of the bodies S and T should either remain, or be changed in any given ratio ; these forces (that is, the force of the body T, which obliges the body P to deflect from a rectilinear course into the orbit PAB, and the force of the body S, which causes the body P to deviate from that orbit) would act always in the same manner, and in the same propor tion : it follows, that all the effects will be similar and proportional, arid the times of those effects proportional also ; that is, that all the linear er rors will be as tne diameters of the orbits, the angular errors the same as before ; and the times of similar linear errors, or equal angular errors? as the periodical times of the orbits.

And the explication thereof requires a composition of forces so perplexed and so variable, that it is hardly to be reconciled with any physical theory. That there are centripetal forces actually directed to the bodies of the sun, of the earth, and other planets, I thus infer. The moon revolves about our earth, and by radii drawn to its centre (p. 390) describes areas nearly proportional to the times in which they are described, as is evident from its velocity compared with its apparent diame ter ; for its motion is slower when its diameter is less (and therefore its distance greater), and its motion is swifter when its diameter is greater. The revolutions of the satellites of Jupiter about that planet are more regular (p. 386) : for they describe circles concentric with Jupiter by equa ble motions, as exactly as our senses can distinguish. And so the satellites of Saturn are revolved about this planet with mo tions nearly (p. 387) circular and equable, scarcely disturbed by any eccen tricity hitherto observed. That Venus and Mercury are revolved about the sun, is demonstrable from their moon-like appearances (p. 388) . when they shine with a full face, they are in those parts of their orbs which in respect of the earth lie beyond the sun ; when they appear half full, they are in those parts whicli Ire over against the sun ; when horned, in those parts which lie between the earth and the sun ; and sometimes they pass over the sun's disk, when directly interposed between the eirth and the sun. And Venus, with a motion almost uniform, describes an orb nearly cir cular and concentric with the sun. But Mercury, with a more eccentric motion, makes remarkable ap proaches to the sun, and goes off again by turns ; but it is always swifter as it is near to the sun, and therefore by a radius drawn to the sun still describes areas proportional to the times. Lastly, that the earth describes about the sun, or the sun about the earth, by a radius from the one to the other, areas exactly proportional to the times, is demonstrable from the apparent diameter of the sun com pared with its apparent motion. These are astronomical experiments ; from which it follows, by Prop. I, 516 THE SYSTEM OF THE WORLD. 11, III,",
