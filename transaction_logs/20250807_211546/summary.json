      "question": "If an insured person takes treatment for arthritis at home because no hospital beds are available, under what circumstances would these expenses NOT be covered, even if a doctor declares the treatment was medically required?",

      "answer": "The claim is admissible because the child is a covered dependent and dental surgery after an accident is covered only when it requires hospitalisation, so the claim can be made (cash‑less or reimbursement) provided hospitalisation is involved, with cash‑less approval at discharge and reimbursement to be submitted within 15 days of discharge.",

      "answer": "The IONM, classified as a modern treatment, is limited to 50 % of the sum insured, and ICU care in a city of over one‑million population is subject to a room‑rent limit of 4 % of the sum insured (with all other ICU expenses reimbursed on an actual‑expense basis).",

What is the claim eligibility for the newborn's treatment expenses, referencing definitions, exclusions, and newborn cover terms?",
      "answer": "The newborn is covered as a “New Born Baby” (up to 90 days) and its intensive‑care treatment is claimable under the maternity benefit (limited to ₹ 50,000 and within the family sum‑insured) on an IPD basis despite the infant’s death.",

Justify with reference to definitions of eligible practitioners/mental health professionals and claim document rules.",
      "answer": "No, because the policy’s claim documentation requirements mandate certification by a qualified medical practitioner for inpatient psychiatric treatment, and a general‑practitioner prescription together with a discharge summary from a clinical psychologist do not satisfy the required practitioner qualification as defined in the policy.",

      "answer": "Neither ECG electrodes nor gloves are admissible for reimbursement because the policy’s annexures list only hospitalisation‑related expenses (e.g., room, ICU, pre‑/post‑hospitalisation, ambulance, donor, etc.) and do not include such consumables, so they are excluded.",

      "answer": "Both the pre‑hospitalisation expenses incurred 18 days before admission and the post‑hospitalisation diagnostics and pharmacy expenses incurred 20 days after discharge are claimable because the policy provides “Actual Expenses Incurred” coverage for pre‑hospitalisation up to 30 days and for post‑hospitalisation up to 60 days for the same illness, which both fall within those limits.",

      "answer": "The expenses are reimbursed only up to the stipulated room‑rent limit of 2 % of the sum insured for a normal private room (or 4 % for ICU) with any excess amount (including the higher‑category private‑room charge) borne by the insured, while diagnostic and specialist fees are reimbursed on an actual‑expense basis, as set out in the “Other Special Conditions” clause 1 regarding room‑rent limits and higher‑category admission.",

      "answer": "Since the policy requires documents to be submitted within 15 days of discharge (or of the claim event) and the insured’s resubmission after 10 days therefore meets the timeline, the insured may then invoke the policy’s grievance procedure by filing a formal grievance with the insurer/TPA within the stipulated 15‑day period after receiving the final rejection.",

      "answer": "Only the employee (self) and the spouse can be added mid‑policy because the family‑floater definition explicitly covers “Self, Employee/Member’s legal spouse, Children” and does not include siblings, and the insurer requires proof of identity and relationship (e.g., government‑issued ID plus marriage certificate for the spouse, and similar relationship documents for any dependents).",
