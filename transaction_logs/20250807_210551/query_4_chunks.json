To keep it healthy, it should be\n   tuned regularly, which will also help reduce pollution and improve vehicle performance &\n   fuel efficiency.\n•  Regular servicing: Get your vehicle serviced at an Authorised           Hero MotoCorp\n   workshop, as per the service schedule, for an optimum performance and keep the emission\n   level under check.\n•  Genuine spares:   Always insist on Hero MotoCorp genuine parts as spurious or\n   incompatible spares and accessories can upset or deteriorate your vehicle’s running\n   condition.\n•  Genuine engine oil: Hero 4T Plus SAE 10W 30 SL grade (JASO MA2) engine oil\n   recommended by Hero MotoCorp and make sure you change it every 6000 km. (with\n   top up every 3000 kilometres) to keep the engine fit and environment healthy.\n•  Noise pollution : Noise beyond a certain decibel is pollution. Whether it is from horns or\n   defective mufflers, excessive noise will cause headaches and discomfort.\n•  Emission pollution: Get emission of your vehicle checked by Authorised agencies atleast\n   once every 3 months or as notified by the government from time to time.",
