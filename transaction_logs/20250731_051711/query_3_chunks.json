A defective catalytic converter contributes to air pollution and can impair your engine’s performance. CATALYTIC CONVERTER This vehicle is equipped with the catalytic converter (1) in the muffler to meet the emission norms. The catalytic converter contains precious metals that serve as catalysts, promoting chemical reactions to convert the exhaust gasses without affecting the metals. The catalytic converter acts on HC, CO and NOx. The catalytic converter must operate at a high temperature for the chemical reactions to take place. It can set on fire any combustible material that come near it. Park your vehicle away from high grasses, dry leaves, or other flammable material. Follow these guidelines to protect your vehicle’s catalytic converter. • Always use unleaded petrol. Even a small amount of leaded petrol can contaminate the catalyst metals, making the catalytic",
