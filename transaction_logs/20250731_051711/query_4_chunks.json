It can set on fire any combustible material that come near it. Park your vehicle away from high grasses, dry leaves, or other flammable material. Follow these guidelines to protect your vehicle’s catalytic converter. • Always use unleaded petrol. Even a small amount of leaded petrol can contaminate the catalyst metals, making the catalytic converter ineffective. • Keep the engine in good running condition. A poorly running engine can cause the catalytic converter to overheat. • If your engine is misfiring, backfiring, stalling, or otherwise not running properly, stop riding and turn “OFF” the engine.Have your vehicle serviced as soon aspossible. HEADLAMP FOCUS ADJUSTMENT Headlamp is factory preset. However in case of adjustment required, please follow the steps as given below: • Headlamp adjustment is done by the headlamp adjusting bolt (1) located below headlamp. • Park the vehicle on level ground. • Turn the ignition switch to “ON” ( ) position and start the engine. • amp Adjust the headl beam vertically by the loosening bolt & move the headlamp unit forward & backward for correct focus adjustment. 67 (1) Canister 1 NOTE Polishing or waxing is not applicable for models having matte paint. After washing your vehicle, wax all painted surfaces (except matte painted surfaces) using a commercially available polish/quality liquid or paste wax to finish the job.

POLISHING OF VEHICLE EVAPORATIVE EMISSION CONTROL SYSTEM This vehicle is equipped with an evaporative emission control system to meet emission standards. During warm weather, the petrol vapours which contain HC evaporates easily into the atmosphere from the fuel tank, if the fuel system is unsealed or open. The evaporative emission control system is used to prevent petrol vapours from escaping into the atmosphere from fuel tank. The canister (1) collects the fuel vapour from the fuel tank and then the fuel vapour is drawn into the engine for re-burning to avoid pollution caused by the fuel vapour diffused into the air.
