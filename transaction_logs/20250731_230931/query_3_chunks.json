Continuous brake application can overheat the brakes and reduce their effectiveness. • When riding in wet or rainy conditions, or on loose surfaces, apply front brake carefully after applying rear brake to avoid wheel slip. • Extreme braking may cause wheel locking and reduce control over the vehicle. • Wherever possible, reduce speed or apply brake before entering a turn, closing the throttle or braking in mid turn may cause wheel slip. Wheel slip will reduce control over the vehicle. • All your actions should be smooth under these conditions. Sudden acceleration, braking or turning may cause loss of control.
