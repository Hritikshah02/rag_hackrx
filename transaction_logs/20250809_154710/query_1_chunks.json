It's time to explore, understand, and ﬂy.\"\n  — HackRx Core Team\n\n🌍 The Strange New World\n\nSachin, one of the core members of HackRx, woke up in a strange version of Earth. Everything looked familiar\n— the air, the people, the languages — but something was… off.\n\nHe walked through the streets of a place that seemed like Delhi. But there it was — the Gateway of India\nstanding tall where India Gate should be. Confused, Sachin kept exploring.\n\nHe realized he had landed in a parallel world, where famous landmarks existed, but they were in the wrong\ncities.\n\nEach city had been swapped with the identity of another, and now it was up to Sachin — and you — to make\nsense of this twisted map.\n\nYour goal: Find the ﬂight number which takes him the real world\n\n🧩 A Tangled Trail — What Sachin Noticed\n\n  Indian Cities\n\n                        Landmark                                          Current Location\n\n 🏛 Gateway of India                Delhi\n\n 🏛 India Gate                      Mumbai\n\n 🕌 Charminar                       Chennai\n\n 🏖 Marina Beach                    Hyderabad\n\n 🌉 Howrah Bridge                   Ahmedabad\n\n 🏰 Golconda Fort                   Mysuru\n\n 🗼 Qutub Minar                     Kochi\n\n                                                                                               Page 1 of 4",
