      "question": "How does Newton define 'quantity of motion' and how is it distinct from 'force'?",
      "answer": "Newton defines the quantity of motion as the measure arising from the velocity and quantity of matter, distinct from force which is the cause of motion or change in motion.",
      "retrieved_chunks_file": "transaction_logs/20250802_155142/query_1_chunks.json"

    {
      "question": "According to Newton, what are the three laws of motion and how do they apply in celestial mechanics?",

    {
      "question": "How does Newton derive Kepler's Second Law (equal areas in equal times) from his laws of motion and gravitation?",

    },
    {
      "question": "How does Newton demonstrate that gravity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between two masses?",
      "answer": "Newton demonstrates that gravity is reciprocally proportional to the square of the distance between two masses through mathematical principles and observations of celestial bodies.",
      "retrieved_chunks_file": "transaction_logs/20250802_155142/query_4_chunks.json"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is Newton's argument for why gravitational force must act on all masses universally?",
      "answer": "Newton's argument for universal gravitational force is that it arises from the universal nature of matter, with the force of any whole globe being composed of the forces of all its parts.",
      "retrieved_chunks_file": "transaction_logs/20250802_155142/query_5_chunks.json"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does Newton explain the perturbation of planetary orbits due to other planets?",
      "answer": "Newton explains that the mutual actions of planets upon one another are so small that they can be neglected, causing less disturbance than if the motions were performed about a sun at rest.",
      "retrieved_chunks_file": "transaction_logs/20250802_155142/query_6_chunks.json"
    },
    {
      "question": "What mathematical tools did Newton use in Principia that were precursors to calculus, and why didn't he use standard calculus notation?",
      "answer": "Newton utilized the Method of Fluxions and the Binomial Theorem, precursors to calculus, and he did not use standard calculus notation because he favored the geometrical method over algebraic calculations.",
      "retrieved_chunks_file": "transaction_logs/20250802_155142/query_7_chunks.json"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does Newton use the concept of centripetal force to explain orbital motion?",
      "answer": "Newton uses centripetal force to explain orbital motion by demonstrating that it is the force directed towards a central body that retains other bodies in their orbits, preventing them from flying off in straight lines.",
      "retrieved_chunks_file": "transaction_logs/20250802_155142/query_8_chunks.json"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does Newton handle motion in resisting media, such as air or fluids?",
      "answer": "Newton analyzes motion in resisting media by examining how the resistance arises from the fluid's inactivity and the pressure exerted by the fluid's compressed parts on a moving body.",
      "retrieved_chunks_file": "transaction_logs/20250802_155142/query_9_chunks.json"
    },
    {
      "question": "In what way does Newton's notion of absolute space and time differ from relative motion, and how does it support his laws?",
      "answer": "Newton's concept of absolute space and time, which are immutable and independent of external factors, serves as the framework for defining absolute motion as translation between these absolute places, thereby supporting his laws by providing a universal reference for motion and rest.",

    {
      "question": "Who was the grandfather of Isaac Newton?",
      "answer": "The grandfather of Isaac Newton was Robert Newton.",

    },
    {
      "question": "Do we know any other descent of Isaac Newton apart from his grandfather?",
      "answer": "Beyond his grandfather, Robert Newton, the descent of Sir Isaac Newton cannot be traced with certainty.",
