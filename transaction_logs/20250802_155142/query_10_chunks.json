Thus in a ship under          sail, the relative place of a body\nis that part of the ship which      the body     possesses ; or that part of its cavity:\nwhich   the body  fills, and  which    therefore       moves together     with  the    ship\nand  relative   rest is the continuance     of the body      in the same        part  of the\nship, or of its cavity.

By  the first\ntwo   Laws  and   the first two   Corollaries,   Galileo  discovered   that     the de\nscent  of bodies   observed    the duplicate   ratio of the time, and     that  the mo\ntion   of projectiles was    in  the  curve  of  a parabola;   experience      agreeing\nwith   both, unless     so far as these  motions    are a little retarded   by the re\nsistance   of the  air.     When    a body  is falling, the   uniform      force of its\ngravity    acting equally,  impresses,   in equal particles   of time,    equal  forces\nupon   that body, and     therefore  generates   equal velocities;   and   in the whole\ntime   impresses   a whole   force, and  generates  a whole   velocity    proportional\nto the time.      And   the spaces   described   in proportional     times are   as the\nvelocities   and  the    times conjunctly ; that    is, in a duplicate    ratio  of the\ntimes.",
