For these cases are alike demonstrated. COR. 7. These things which have been demonstrated concerning gravity take place in any other centripetal forces. COR. 8. Therefore if the medium in which any body moves be acted on either by its own gravity, or by any other centripetal force, and the body be urged more powerfully by the same force ; the difference of the forces is that very motive force, which, in the foregoing Propositions, I have con sidered as a centripetal force. But if the body be more lightly urged by that force, the difference of the forces becomes a centrifugal force, and is tc be considered as such. COR. 9. But since fluids by pressing the included bodies do not change their external figures, it appears also (by Cor. Prop. XIX) that they will not change the situation of their internal parts in relation to onf another ; and therefore if animals were immersed therein, and that all sen sation did arise from the motion of their parts, the fluid will neither hurt the immersed bodies, nor excite any sensation, unless so far as those bodies may be condensed by the compression. And the case is the same of any system of bodies encompassed with a compressing fluid. All the parts of the system will be agitated with the same motions as if they were placed in a vacuum, and would only retain their comparative gravity ; unless so far as the fluid may somewhat resist their motions, or be requisite to con- glutinate them by compression. PROPOSITION XXI. THEOREM XVI. £<et the density of any fluid be proportional to the compression, and its parts be attracted downwards by a centripetal force reciprocally pro portional to the distances from the centre : I say, that, if those dis tances be taken continually proportional, the densities of the fluid at the same distances will be also continually proportional. Let ATV denote the spherical bottom of the fluid, S the centre, S A, SB. SC, SD, SE, SF, &c., distances continually proportional.

But, yet, that the resistance of bodies is in the ratio of the velocity, is more a mathematical hypothesis than a physical one.

Ff a body is resisted in the duplicate ratio of its velocity, and moves by its innate force only through a similar medium; and the times be taken in a geometrical progression, proceeding from less to greater terms : I say, that the velocities at the beginning of each of the times are in the same geometrical progression inversely ; and that the spaces are equal, which are described in each of the times. For since the resistance of the medium is proportional to the square of the velocity, and the decrement of the velocity is proportional to the resist ance : if the time be divided into innumerable equal particles, the squares of the velocities at the beginning of each of the times will be proportional to the differences of the same velocities. Let those particles of time be AK, KL, LM, &c., taken in the right line CD; and erect the perpendiculars AB, Kk, L/, Mm, &c., meeting the hyperbola BklmG, described with the centre C, and the rectangular asymptotes CD, CH. in B, kj I, m, (fee. ; then AB will be to K",

F a space which is to f D as the den sity of the globe to the density of the medium, that is, as A to A — B, G the time in which the globe falling with the weight B without resistance describes the space P, and H the velocity which the body acquires by that fall.

That resistance which arises from the elasticity, tenacity, and friction of its parts, may be thus investigated.

A fluid is any body whose parts yield to any force impressed on it, by yielding, are easily moved among themselves. PROPOSITION XIX. THEOREM XIv All the parts of a homogeneous and unmoved fluid included in any un moved vessel, and compressed on every side (setting aside the consider ation of condensation, gravity, and all centripetal forces], will be equally pressed on every side, and remain in their places without any motion arising from that pressure. CASE 1. Let a fluid be included in the spherical vessel ABC, and uniformly compressed on every side : 1 say, that no part of it will be moved by that pressure. For if any part, as L), be moved, all such parts at the same distance from the centre on every side must necessarily be moved at the same time by a like motion ; because the pressure of them all is similar and equal ; and all other motion is excluded that does not arise from that pressure. But if these parts come all of them nearer to the centre, the fluid must be condensed towards the centre, contrary to the supposition. If they recede from it, the fluid must be condensed towards the circumfer ence ; which is also contrary to the supposition. Neither can they move in any one direction retaining their distance from the centre, because for the same reason, they may move in a contrary direction :",

OF NATURAL PHILOSOPHY. AXIOMS, OR LAWS OF MOTION. LAW I. Hvery body perseveres in its state of rest, or of uniform motion in a ri^ht line, unless it is compelled to change that state by forces impressed thereon. PROJECTILES persevere in their motions, so far as they are not retarded by the resistance of the air, or impelled downwards by the force of gravity A top, whose parts by their cohesion are perpetually drawn aside from rectilinear motions, does not cease its rotation, otherwise than as it is re tarded by the air. The greater bodies of the planets and comets, meeting with less resistance in more free spaces, preserve then jDotions both pro gressive and circular for a much longer time. LAW II. The alteration of motion is ever proportional to the motive force imp reus ed ; and is made in the direction of the right line in. which that force is impressed. If any force generates a motion, a double force will generate double the motion, a triple force triple the motion, whether that force be impressed altogether and at once, or gradually and successively. And this motion (being always directed the same way with the generating force), if the body moved before, is added to or subducted from the former motion, according as they directly conspire with or are directly contrary to each other ; or obliquely joined, when they are oblique, so as to produce a new motion compounded from the determination of both.

Projectiles excite a motion in fluids as they pass through them, and this motion arises from the excess of the pressure of the fluid at the fore parts of the projectile above the pressure of the same at the hinder parts : and cannot be less in mediums infinitely fluid than it is in air, water, and quick silver, in proportion to the density of matter in each. Now this excess of pressure does, in proportion to its quantity, not only excite a motion in the fluid, but also acts upon the projectile so as to retard its motion ; and there fore the resistance in every fluid is as the motion excited by the projectile in the fluid ; and cannot be less in the most subtile aether in proportion to the density of that aether, than it is in air, water, and Quicksilver, in pro portion to the densities of those fluids.

If they recede from it, the fluid must be condensed towards the circumfer ence ; which is also contrary to the supposition. Neither can they move in any one direction retaining their distance from the centre, because for the same reason, they may move in a contrary direction : but the sami part cannot be moved contrary ways at the same time. Therefore no part of the fluid will be moved from its place. Q,.E.T). CASE 2. I say now, that all the spherical parts of this fluid are equally pressed on every side. For let EF be a spherical part of the fluid ; if this be not pressed equally on every side, augment the lesser pressure till it be pressed equally on every side; and its parts (by Case I) will remain in their places. But before the increase of the pressure, they would remain in their places (by Case 1) ; and by the addition of a new pressure they will be moved, by the definition of a fluid, from those places. Now these two conclusions contradict each other. Therefore it was false to say that the sphere EF was not pressed equally on every side. Q,.E.D. CASE 3. I say besides, that different spherical parts have equal pressures. For the contiguous spherical parts press each other mutually and equally in the point of contact (by Law III).
