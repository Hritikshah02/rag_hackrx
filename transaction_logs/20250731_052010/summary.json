      "question": "How does Newton define 'quantity of motion' and how is it distinct from 'force'?",
      "answer": "Newton defines 'quantity of motion' as the product of celerity and the quantity of matter, distinct from motive force which arises from accelerative force multiplied by the quantity of matter.",

    {
      "question": "What mathematical tools did Newton use in Principia that were precursors to calculus, and why didn't he use standard calculus notation?",
      "answer": "Newton used his method of fluxions, which predated standard calculus notation, because its algorithm and notation were not published until 1693 in Dr. Wallis's works.",

    },
    {
      "question": "How does Newton use the concept of centripetal force to explain orbital motion?",
      "answer": "Newton uses centripetal force to explain orbital motion by demonstrating that a body subject to a force directed towards a central point will move in a specific trajectory, such as an ellipse, with predictable velocity and position over time.",

    },
    {
      "question": "How does Newton handle motion in resisting media, such as air or fluids?",
      "answer": "Newton explains that resistance in fluids is proportional to the square of the velocity, and this resistance is considered as a motive force that can be added to or subtracted from the body's motion, or as a centrifugal force depending on whether the body is urged more or less powerfully by the medium's centripetal force.",

    },
    {
      "question": "In what way does Newton's notion of absolute space and time differ from relative motion, and how does it support his laws?",
      "answer": "Newton distinguishes absolute space and time from relative motion by defining them as independent of any external observer or object's movement, which forms the foundation for his laws of motion by providing a universal reference frame.",
