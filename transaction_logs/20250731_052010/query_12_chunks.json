Its publication seemed to infuse additional bitterness into the feelings of Leibnitz, who descended to unfounded charges and empty threats. He had been privy counsellor to the Elector of Han over, before that prince was elevated to the British throne ; and in his correspondence, in 1715 and 1716, with the Abbe Conti, then at the court of George L, and with Caroline, Princess of Wales, he attacked the doctrines of the PRINCIPIA, and indirectly its author, in a manner very discreditable to himself, both as a learned and as an honourable man. His assaults, however, were triumphantly met; and, to the complete overthrow of his rival pretensions, Newton was induced to give the finishing blow. The verdict is universal and irreversible that the English preceded the German philosopher, by at least ten years, in the invention of fluxions. Newton could not have borrowed from Leibnitz ; but Leibnitz might have borrowed from Newton.

Leibnitz, admiring the beauty of one of them, requested the time for solving it to be extended to twelve months — twice the period originally named. The delay was readily granted. Newton, how ever, sent in, the day after he received the problems, a solution of them to the President of the Royal Society. Bernouilli obtained solutions from Newton, Leibinitz and the Marquis De L'Hopital ; but Newton's though anonymous, he immediately recognised \" tanquam ungue leonem\" as the lion is known by his claw. We may mention here the famous problem of the trajectories proposed by Leibnitz, in 1716, for the purpose of \"feeling the pulse of the English Analysts.\" Newton received the problem about five o'clock in the afternoon, as he was returning from the LIFE OF SIR ISAAC NEWTON. 45 Mint ; and though it was extremely difficult and he himself much fatigued, yet he completed its solution, the same evening before he went to bed. The history of these problems affords, by direct comparison, a striking illustration of Newton's vast superiority of mind. That amazing concentration and grasp of intellect, of which we have spoken, enabled him to master speedily, and, as it were, by a single effort, those things, for the achievement of which, the many would essay utterly in vain, and the very, very few attain only after long and renewed striving. And yet, with a modesty as unparalleled as his power, he attributed his successes, not to any extraordinary sagacity, but solely to industry and patient thought. Mr- kept the subject of consideration constantly before him, and waited till the first dawning opened gradually into a full and clear light ; never quitting, if possible, the mental process till the object of it were wholly gained. He never allowed this habit of meditation to appear in his intercourse with society ; but in the privacy of his own chamber, or in the midst of his own family, he gave himself up to the deepest abstraction. Occupied with some interesting investigation, he would often sit down on his bedside, after he rose, and remain there, for hours, partially dressed. Meal-time would frequently come and pass unheeded ; so that, unless urgently reminded, he would neglect to take the re quisite quantity of nourishment. But notwithstanding his anx iety to be",

It contained a history of the whole matter, and a triumphant reply to the objections of M. Freret. This answer called into the field a fresh antagonist, Father Soueiet, whose five dissertations on this subject were chiefly remarkable for the want of knowledge and want of decorum, which they displayed. In consequence of these discussions, Newton was in duced to prepare his larger work for the press, and had nearly completed it at the time of his death. It was published in 1728, under the title of THE CHRONOLOGY OF THE ANCIENT KINGDOMS AMENDED, TO WHICH is PREFIXED A SHORT CHRONICLE FROM THE FIRST MEMORY OF THINGS IN EUROPE TO THE CONQUEST OF PERSIA BY ALEXANDER THE GREAT. It consists of six chap ters: 1. On the Chronology of the Greeks; according to Whis- ton, our author wrote out eighteen copies of this chapter with his own hand, differing little from one another. 2. Of the Empire of Egypt; 3. Of the Assyrian Empire; 4. Of the two contempo rary Empires of the Babylonians and Medes ; 5. A Description of the Temple of Solomon ; 6. Of the Empire of the Persians ; this chapter was not found copied with the other five, but as it was discovered among his papers, arid appeared to be a continu ation of the same work, the Editor thought proper to add it thereto.

The introduction of the pure and lofty doctrines of the PRIN- CIPIA was perseveringly resisted. Descartes, with his system of vortices, had sown plausibly to the imagination, and error had struck down deeply, and shot up luxuriantly, not only in the popular, but in the scientific mind. Besides the idea — in itself so simple and so grand — that the great masses of the planets were 38 LIFE OF SIR ISAAC NEWTON. suspended in empty space, and retained in their orbits by an in visible influence residing in the sun — was to the ignorant a thing inconceivable, and to the learned a revival of the occult qualities of the ancient physics. This remark applies particularly to the continent. Leibnitz misapprehended ; Huygens in part rejected ; John Bernouilli opposed ; and Fontenelle never received the doc trines of the PRINCIPIA. So that, the saying of Voltaire is prob ably true, that though Newton survived the publication of his great work more than forty years, yet, at the time of his death, lie had not above twenty followers out of England. But in England, the reception of our author's philosophy was rapid and triumphant. His own labours, while Lucasian Pro fessor ; those of his successors in that Chair — Whiston and Saunderson ; those of Dr. Samuel Clarke, Dr. Laughton, Roger Cotes, and Dr. Bentley ; the experimental lectures of Dr. Keill and Desaguliers ; the early and powerful exertions of David Gregory at Edinburgh, and of his brother James Gregory at St. Andrew's, tended to diffuse widely in England and Scotland a knowledge of, and taste for the truths of the PRINCIPIA. Indeed, its mathematical doctrines constituted, from the first, a regular part of academical instruction ; while its physical truths, given to the public in popular lectures, illustrated by experiments, had, before the lapse of twenty ) ( ar.s, become familiar to, and adopted by the general mind.

And so your question about the cause of phantasm in volves another about the power of fancy, which I must confess is too hard a knot for me to untie. To place this effect in a constant motion is hard, because the sun ought then to appear perpetually. It seems rather to consist in a disposition of the sensorium to move the imagination strongly, and to be easily moved, both by the imagination and by the light, as often as bright objects are looked upon.\"J Though Newton had continued silent, yet his thoughts were by no means inactive upon the vast subject of the planetary mo tions. The idea of Universal Gravitation, first caught sight of, so to speak, in the garden at Woolsthorpe, years ago, had gradually expanded upon him. We find him, in a letter to Dr. Hooke, Secretary of the Royal Society, dated in November, 1679, pro posing to verify the motion of the earth by direct experiment, namely, by the observation of the path pursued by a body falling from a considerable height. He had concluded that the path would be spiral ; but Dr. Hooke maintained that it would be an eccentric ellipse iu vacuo, and an ellipti-spiral in a resisting me dium. Our author, aided by this correction of his error, and by 30 LIFE OF SIR ISAAC NEWTON. the discovery that a projectile would move in an elliptical orbil when under the influence of a force varying inversely as the square of the distance, was led to discover \" the theorem bj which he afterwards examined the ellipsis ;\" and to demonstrate the celebrated proposition that a planet acted upon by an attrac tive force varying inversely as the squares of the distances will describe an elliptical orbit, in one of whose foci the attractive force resides. When he was attending a meeting of the Royal Society, in June 1682, the conversation fell upon the subject of the measure ment of a degree of the meridian, executed by M. Picard, a French Astronomer, in 1679. Newton took a memorandum oi the result ; and afterward, at the earliest opportunity, computed from it the diameter of the earth : furnished with these new data, he resumed his calculation of 1666. As he proceeded therein, he saw that his early",

I have often LIFE OF SIR ISAAC NEWTON. 57 heard him censure the handling geometrical subjects ly algebraic calculations ; and his book of Algebra he called by the name of Universal Arithmetic, in opposition to the injudicious title of Geometry, which Descartes had given to the treatise, wherein he shows how the geometer may assist his invention by such kind of computations. He thought Huygens the most elegant of any mathematical writer of modern times, and the most just imitator of the ancients. Of their taste and form of demonstration, Sir Isaac always professed himself a great admirer. I have heard him even censure himself for not following them yet more closely than he did ; and speak with regret of his mistake at the begin ning of his mathematical studies, in applying himself to the works of Descartes and other algebraic writers, before he had considered the elements of Euclid with that attention which so excellent a writer deserves.\" \" Though his memory was much decayed,\" continues Dr. Pem- berton, \"he perfectly understood his own writings.\" And even this failure of memory, we would suggest, might have been more apparent than real, or, in medical terms, more the result of func tional weakness than organic decay. Newton seems never to have confided largely to his memory : and as this faculty mani fests the most susceptibility to cultivation ; so, in the neglect of due exercise, it more readily and plainly shows a diminution of its powers.

In forming this conclusion, he supposed the planets to move in perfect circles, concentric to the sun. Now was this the law of the moon's motion ? Was such a force, em anating from the earth and directed to the moon, sufficient, when diminished as the square of the distance, to retain her in her orbit ? To ascertain this master-fact, he compared the space through which heavy bodies fall, in a second of time, at a given distance from the centre of the earth, namely, at its surface, with the space through which the moon falls, as it were, to the earth, in the same time, while revolving in a circular orbit. He was absent from books ; and, therefore, adopted, in computing the earth's diameter, the common estimate of sixty miles to a degree of latitude as then in use among geographers and navigators. The result of his calculations did not, ot course, answer his ex pectations ; hence, he concluded that some other cause, beyond the reach of observation — analogous, perhaps, to the vortices of Des cartes — joined its action to that of the power of gravity upon the rnooil. Though by no means satisfied, he yet abandoned awhile further inquiry, and remained totally silent upon the subject. These rapid marches in the career of discovery, combined with the youth of Newton, seem to evince a penetration the most lively, and an invention the most exuberant. But in him there was a conjunction of influences as extraordinary as fortunate. Study, unbroken, persevering and profound carried on its inform ing and disciplining work upon a genius, natively the greatest, and rendered freest in its movements, and clearest in its vision, through the untrammelling and enlig} tenirig power of religion.
