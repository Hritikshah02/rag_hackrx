A projectile, if it was not for the force of gravity, would not deviate towards the earth, tut would OF NATUJIAL PHILOSOPHY. 7fl go off from it in a right line, and that with an uniform motion,, if the re sistance of the air was taken away. It is by its gravity that it is drawn aside perpetually from its rectilinear course, and made to deviate towards the earth, more or less, according to the force of its gravity, and the velo city of its motion. The less its gravity is, for the quantity of its matter, or the greater the velocity with which it is projected, the less will it devi ate from a rectilinear course, and the farther it will go. If a leaden balJ, projected from the top of a mountain by the force of gunpowder with a given velocity, and in a direction parallel to the horizon, is carried in a curve line to the distance of two miles before it falls to the ground ; the same, if the resistance of the air were taken away, with a double or decuple velocity, would fly twice or ten times as far. And by increasing the velo city, we may at pleasure increase the distance to which it might be pro jected, and diminish the curvature of the line, which it might describe, till at last it should fall at the distance of 10, 30, or 90 degrees, or even might go quite round the whole earth before it falls ; or lastly, so that it might never fall to the earth, but go forward into the celestial spaces, and pro ceed in its motion in iiifiuitum. And after the same manner that a pro jectile, by the force of gravity, may be made to revolve in an orbit, and go round the whole earth, the moon also, either by the force of gravity, if it is endued with gravity, or by any other force, that impels it towards the earth, may be perpetually drawn aside towards the earth, out of the r&ti- linear way, which by its innate force it would pursue; and would be made to revolve in the orbit which it now describes ; nor could the moon with out some such force, be retained in its orbit. If this force was too small, it would not sufficiently turn the moon out of a rectilinear course : if it was too",

Pemberton's popular \" View of Sir Isaac Newton's Philosophy\" was published, in 1728 ; and the year after ward, an English translation of the PRINCIPIA, and System of the World, by Andrew Motte. And since that period, the labours of Le Seur and Jacquier, of Thorpe, of Jebb, of Wright and others have greatly contributed to display the most hidden treasures of the PRINCIPIA. About the time of the publication of the Principia, James II., bent on re-establishing the Romish Faith, had, among other ille gal acts, ordered by mandamus, the University of Cambridge to confer the degree of Master of Arts upon an ignorant monk. Obedience to this mandate was resolutely refused. Newton was one of the nine delegates chosen to defend the independence of the University. They appeared before the High Court ; — and LIFE OF SIR ISAAC NEWTON. 39 successfully : the king abandoned his design. The prominent part which our author took in these proceedings, and his eminence in the scientific world, induced his proposal as one of the parlia mentary representatives of the University. He was elected, in 1688, and sat in the Convention Parliament till its dissolution. After the first year, however, he seems to have given little or no attention to his parliamentary duties, being seldom absent from the University till his appointment in the Mint, in 1695. Newton began his theological researches sometime previous to 1691 ; in the prime of his years, and in the matured vigour of his intellectual powers. From his youth, as we have seen, he had devoted himself with an activity the most unceasing, and an energy almost superhuman to the discovery of physical truth ; — giving to Philosophy a new foundation, and to Science a new temple. To pass on, then, from the consideration of the material, more directly to that of the spiritual, was a natural, nay, with so large and devout a soul, a necessary advance. The Bible was to him of inestimable worth. In the elastic freedom, which a pure and unswerving faith in",

If this force was too small, it would not sufficiently turn the moon out of a rectilinear course : if it was too great, it would turn it too much, arid draw down the moon from its orbit towards the earth. It is necessary, that the force be of a just quantity, and it belongs to the mathematicians to find the force, that may serve exactly to retain a body in a given orbit, with a given velocity ; and vice versa, to determine the curvilinear way, into which a body projected from a given place, with a given velocity, may be made to deviate from its natural rectilinear way, by means of a given force. The quantity of any centripetal force may be considered as of three kinds; aboolu'e, accelerative, and motive. DEFINITION VI. The absolute quantity of a centripetal force is the measure f>f the same proportional to the efficacy of the cause that propagates it from the cen tre, through the spaces round about. Thus the magnetic force is greater in one load-stone and less in another according to their sizes and strength of intensity. 76 THE MATHEMATICAL PRINCIPLES DEFINITION VII. The accelerative quantity of a centripetal force is the measure, of tht same, proportional to the velocity which it generates in a given time. Thus the force of the same load-stone is greater at a less distance, and less at a greater : also the force of gravity is greater in valleys, less on tops of exceeding high mountains ; and yet less (as shall hereafter be shown), at greater distances from the body of the earth ; but at equal distan ces, it is the same everywhere ; because (taking away, or allowing for, the resistance of the air), it equally accelerates all falling bodies, whether heavy or light, great or small.

The introduction of the pure and lofty doctrines of the PRIN- CIPIA was perseveringly resisted. Descartes, with his system of vortices, had sown plausibly to the imagination, and error had struck down deeply, and shot up luxuriantly, not only in the popular, but in the scientific mind. Besides the idea — in itself so simple and so grand — that the great masses of the planets were 38 LIFE OF SIR ISAAC NEWTON. suspended in empty space, and retained in their orbits by an in visible influence residing in the sun — was to the ignorant a thing inconceivable, and to the learned a revival of the occult qualities of the ancient physics. This remark applies particularly to the continent. Leibnitz misapprehended ; Huygens in part rejected ; John Bernouilli opposed ; and Fontenelle never received the doc trines of the PRINCIPIA. So that, the saying of Voltaire is prob ably true, that though Newton survived the publication of his great work more than forty years, yet, at the time of his death, lie had not above twenty followers out of England. But in England, the reception of our author's philosophy was rapid and triumphant. His own labours, while Lucasian Pro fessor ; those of his successors in that Chair — Whiston and Saunderson ; those of Dr. Samuel Clarke, Dr. Laughton, Roger Cotes, and Dr. Bentley ; the experimental lectures of Dr. Keill and Desaguliers ; the early and powerful exertions of David Gregory at Edinburgh, and of his brother James Gregory at St. Andrew's, tended to diffuse widely in England and Scotland a knowledge of, and taste for the truths of the PRINCIPIA.
