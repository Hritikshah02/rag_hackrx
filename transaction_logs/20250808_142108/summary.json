      "answer": "Since the policy only states that maternity expenses are payable for in‑patient treatment in Indian hospitals and does not specify an approved‑hospital list, coverage for a scheduled caesarean at an out‑of‑town non‑approved hospital cannot be confirmed; mid‑term inclusion of a newborn is allowed from day one upon payment of the required premium; and any change of the primary insured’s communication email must be communicated to the company in writing.",
