      "question": "How does Newton define 'quantity of motion' and how is it distinct from 'force'?",
      "answer": "Newton defines quantity of motion as the product of celerity and the quantity of matter, distinguishing it from motive force, which is the product of accelerative force and the quantity of matter.",

    {
      "question": "What mathematical tools did Newton use in Principia that were precursors to calculus, and why didn't he use standard calculus notation?",
      "answer": "Newton used his method of fluxions, the fundamental principle of which was first published in the second lemma of the second book of the *Principia*, but its algorithm or notation did not appear until 1693 in Dr. Wallis's works.",

    },
    {
      "question": "How does Newton use the concept of centripetal force to explain orbital motion?",
      "answer": "Newton explains orbital motion by resolving centripetal forces into components that either maintain motion within a plane or directly attract a body towards a central point, causing it to revolve.",

    },
    {
      "question": "How does Newton handle motion in resisting media, such as air or fluids?",
      "answer": "Newton handles motion in resisting media by considering how projectile motion is affected by air resistance and how fluid resistance relates to the velocity of bodies moving through them.",
      "retrieved_chunks_file": "transaction_logs/20250731_234348/query_9_chunks.json"
    },
    {
      "question": "In what way does Newton's notion of absolute space and time differ from relative motion, and how does it support his laws?",
      "answer": "Newton's absolute space and time are independent of any external objects or motions, differing from relative motion which is defined by the relationship between objects, thereby providing a fixed framework to support his laws of motion.",
