Then (by Cor. 5, of the Laws, and the last Theorem) the subse quent motions will be performed in the same manner in that space, as if that space together with the common centre of gravity were at rest, and as if the bodies did not attract each other, but were attracted by a third body placed in that centre. The motion therefore in this movable space of each body going off from a given place, in a given direction, with a given velo city, and acted upon by a centripetal force tending to that centre, is to be determined by Prob.

These planes are supposed to be perfectly smooth and polished, so as not to retard the motion of the bodies in the least. Moreover, in these demonstrations, instead of the planes upon which those bodies roll or slide, and which are therefore tangent planes to the bodies, I shall use planes parallel to them, in which the centres of the bodies move, and by that motion describe orbits.

But if we now imagine bodies to be projected in the directions of lines parallel to the horizon from greater heights, as of 5, 10, 100, 1000, or more miles, or rather as many semi-diameters of the earth, those bodies, accord ing to their different velocity, and the different force of gravity in different heights, will describe arcs either concentric with the earth, or variously eccentric, and go on revolving through the heavens in those trajectories, just as the planets do in their orbs. As when a stone is projected obliquely, that is, any way but in the per pendicular direction, the perpetual deflection thereof towards the earth from the right line in which it was projected is a proof of its gravitation to the earth, no less certain than its direct descent when only suffered to fall freely from rest ; so the deviation of bodies moving in free spaces from rectilinear paths, and perpetual deflection therefrom towards any place, is a sure indication of the existence of some force which from all quarters impels those bodies towards that place. And as, from the supposed existence of gravity, it necessarily follows that all bodies about the earth must press downwards, and therefore must either descend directly to the earth, if they are let fall from rest, or at least perpetually deviate from right lines towards the earth, if they arc projected obliquely ; so from the supposed existence of a force directed to any centre, it will follow, by the like necessity, that all bodies upon which this force acts mast either descend directly to that centre, or at least devi ate perpetually towards it from right lines, if otherwise they should have moved obliquely in these right lines. And how from the motions given we may infer the forces, or from the forces given we may determine the motions, is shewn in the two first Books of our Principles of Philosophy. If the earth is supposed to stand still, and the fixed stars to be revolved in free spaces in the space of 24 hours, it is certain the forces by which the fixed stars are retained in their orbs are not directed to the earth, but to the centres of the several orbs, that is, of the several parallel circles, which the fixed stars, declining to one side and the other from the equator, describe daily ; also that by radii drawn to the centres of those orbs th",

But if we observed the cord, and found that its tension was that very tension which the motions of the globes required, we might conclude the motion to be in the globes, and the bodies to be at rest ; and then, lastly, from the trans lation of the globes among the bodies, we should find the determination oi their motions. But how we are to collect the true motions from their causes, effects, and apparent differences ; and, vice versa, how from the mo tions, either true or apparent, we may come to the knowledge of theii causes and effects, shall be explained more at large in the following tra<;t For to this end it was that I composed it. OF NATURAL PHILOSOPHY. AXIOMS, OR LAWS OF MOTION. LAW I. Hvery body perseveres in its state of rest, or of uniform motion in a ri^ht line, unless it is compelled to change that state by forces impressed thereon. PROJECTILES persevere in their motions, so far as they are not retarded by the resistance of the air, or impelled downwards by the force of gravity A top, whose parts by their cohesion are perpetually drawn aside from rectilinear motions, does not cease its rotation, otherwise than as it is re tarded by the air. The greater bodies of the planets and comets, meeting with less resistance in more free spaces, preserve then jDotions both pro gressive and circular for a much longer time. LAW II. The alteration of motion is ever proportional to the motive force imp reus ed ; and is made in the direction of the right line in. which that force is impressed. If any force generates a motion, a double force will generate double the motion, a triple force triple the motion, whether that force be impressed altogether and at once, or gradually and successively. And this motion (being always directed the same way with the generating force), if the body moved before, is added to or subducted from the former motion, according as they directly conspire with or are directly contrary to each other ; or obliquely joined, when they are oblique, so as to produce a new motion compounded from the determination of both. LAW III. To every action there is always opposed an equal reaction : or the mu tual actions of two bodies",
