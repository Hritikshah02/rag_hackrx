There were no \"resentments,\" how ever, as we conceive, in his \" design to suppress.\" He sought peace ; for he loved and valued it above all applause. But, in spite of his efforts for tranquillity's sake, his course of discovery was all along molested by ignorance or presumptuous rivalry. The publication of the great work now went rapidly forwards, The second book was sent to the Society, and presented on the 2d March ; the third, on the 6th April ; and the whole was com pleted and published in the month of May, 1686-7. In the sec ond Lemma of the second book, the fundamental principle of his fiuxionary calculus was, for the first time, given to the world ; but its algorithm or notation did not appear till published in the second volume nf Dr. Wallis's works, in 1693. And thus was ushered into existence The PRINCIPIA — a work to which pre-eminence above all the productions of the human intellect has been awarded — a work that must be esteemed of priceless worth so long as Science has a votary, or a single wor shipper be left to kneel at the altar of Truth. LIFE OF SIR ISAAC NEWTON. 33 The entire work bears the general title of THE MATHEMATICAL PRINCIPLES OF NATURAL PHILOSOPHY. It consists of three books: the first two, entitled, OF THE MOTION OF BODIES, are occupied with the laws and conditions of motions and forces, and are illus trated with many scholia treating of some of the most general and best established points in philosophy, such as the density and resistance of bodies, spaces void of matter, and the motion of sound and light. From these principles, there is deduced, in the third book, drawn up in as popular a style as possible and entitled, OF THE SYSTEM OF THE WORLD, the constitution of the system of i he world. In regard to this book, the author say^ — \" I had, indeed, composed the third Book in a popular method, that it might be read by many ; but afterwards, considering that such as had not suf- ficently entered into the principles could not easily discover the strength of the consequences, nor lay aside the prejudices to which they had been many years accustomed, therefore,",

Pemberton's popular \" View of Sir Isaac Newton's Philosophy\" was published, in 1728 ; and the year after ward, an English translation of the PRINCIPIA, and System of the World, by Andrew Motte. And since that period, the labours of Le Seur and Jacquier, of Thorpe, of Jebb, of Wright and others have greatly contributed to display the most hidden treasures of the PRINCIPIA. About the time of the publication of the Principia, James II., bent on re-establishing the Romish Faith, had, among other ille gal acts, ordered by mandamus, the University of Cambridge to confer the degree of Master of Arts upon an ignorant monk. Obedience to this mandate was resolutely refused. Newton was one of the nine delegates chosen to defend the independence of the University. They appeared before the High Court ; — and LIFE OF SIR ISAAC NEWTON. 39 successfully : the king abandoned his design. The prominent part which our author took in these proceedings, and his eminence in the scientific world, induced his proposal as one of the parlia mentary representatives of the University. He was elected, in 1688, and sat in the Convention Parliament till its dissolution. After the first year, however, he seems to have given little or no attention to his parliamentary duties, being seldom absent from the University till his appointment in the Mint, in 1695. Newton began his theological researches sometime previous to 1691 ; in the prime of his years, and in the matured vigour of his intellectual powers. From his youth, as we have seen, he had devoted himself with an activity the most unceasing, and an energy almost superhuman to the discovery of physical truth ; — giving to Philosophy a new foundation, and to Science a new temple. To pass on, then, from the consideration of the material, more directly to that of the spiritual, was a natural, nay, with so large and devout a soul, a necessary advance. The Bible was to him of inestimable worth. In the elastic freedom, which a pure and unswerving faith in",

Newton was always remarkable for simplicity of dress, and his only known departure from it was on this oc casion, when he is said to have appeared in a suit of laced clothes. The Algebraical Lectures which he had, Juring nine years, delivered at Cambridge, were published by Whiston, in 1707, under the title of ARITHMETICS UNIVERSALIS, SINE DE COMPOSI TIONS ET RESOLUTIONS ARITHMETICA LIBER. This publication is said to have been a breach of confidence on Whiston's part. Mr. Ralphson, not long afterward, translated the work into English ; and a second edition of it, with improvements by the author, was issued at London, 1712, by Dr. Machin. Subsequent editions, both in English and Latin, with commentaries, have been published. In June, 1709, Newton intrusted the superintendence of a second edition of the PRINCIPIA to Roger Cotes, Plumian Pro fessor of Astronomy at Cambridge. The first edition had been sold off for some time. Copies of the work had become very rare, and could only be obtained at several times their original cost. A great number of letters passed oetween the author and Mr. Cotes during the preparation of the edition, which finally appeared in May, 1713. It had many alterations and improve ments, and was accompanied by an admirable Preface from the pen of Cotes.

Leibnitz, admiring the beauty of one of them, requested the time for solving it to be extended to twelve months — twice the period originally named. The delay was readily granted. Newton, how ever, sent in, the day after he received the problems, a solution of them to the President of the Royal Society. Bernouilli obtained solutions from Newton, Leibinitz and the Marquis De L'Hopital ; but Newton's though anonymous, he immediately recognised \" tanquam ungue leonem\" as the lion is known by his claw. We may mention here the famous problem of the trajectories proposed by Leibnitz, in 1716, for the purpose of \"feeling the pulse of the English Analysts.\" Newton received the problem about five o'clock in the afternoon, as he was returning from the LIFE OF SIR ISAAC NEWTON. 45 Mint ; and though it was extremely difficult and he himself much fatigued, yet he completed its solution, the same evening before he went to bed. The history of these problems affords, by direct comparison, a striking illustration of Newton's vast superiority of mind. That amazing concentration and grasp of intellect, of which we have spoken, enabled him to master speedily, and, as it were, by a single effort, those things, for the achievement of which, the many would essay utterly in vain, and the very, very few attain only after long and renewed striving. And yet, with a modesty as unparalleled as his power, he attributed his successes, not to any extraordinary sagacity, but solely to industry and patient thought.

Occupied with some interesting investigation, he would often sit down on his bedside, after he rose, and remain there, for hours, partially dressed. Meal-time would frequently come and pass unheeded ; so that, unless urgently reminded, he would neglect to take the re quisite quantity of nourishment. But notwithstanding his anx iety to be",

At the recommendation of one of his uncles, who had himself studied at Trinity College, Cambridge, Newton proceeded thither, and was duly admitted. on the 5th day of June 1660, in the eighteenth year of his age. The eager student had now entered upon a new and wider field ; and we find him devoting himself to the pursuit of know ledge with amazing ardour and perseverance. Among other sub jects, his attention was soon drawn to that of Judicial Astrology He exposed the folly of this pseudo-science by erecting a figure with the aid of one or two of the problems of Euclid ; — and thus began his study of the Mathematics. His researches into this science were prosecuted with unparallelled vigour and success. Regarding the propositions contained in Euclid as self-evident truths, he passed rapidly over this ancient system — a step which he afterward much regretted — and mastered, without further pre paratory study, the Analytical Geometry of Descartes. Wallis's Arithmetic of Infinites, Saunderson's Logic, and the Optics of Kepler, he also studied with great care ; writing upon them many comments ; and, in these notes on Wallis's work was un doubtedly the germ of his fluxionary calculus. His progress was so great that he found himself more profoundly versed than his tutor in many branches of learning. Yet his acquisitions were not gotten with the rapidity of intuition ; but they were thoroughly made and firmly secured. Quickness of apprehension, or Intel lectual nimbleness did not belong to him. He saw too far : his, insight was too deep. He dwelt fully, cautiously upon the least subject ; while to the consideration of the greatest, he brought a massive strength joined with a matchless clearness, that, regard less of the merely trivial or unimportant, bore with unerring sa gacity upon the prominences of the subject, and, grappling with its difficulties, rarely failed to surmount them. 14 LIFE OF SIR ISAAC NEWTON His early and fast friend, Dr. Barrow — in compass of inven tion only inferior to Newton — who had been elected Professor of Greek in the University, in 1660, was made Lucasian Profes sor of Mathematics in 1663, and soon afterward delivered his Optical Lectures : the manuscripts of these were revised by New ton, and several overs",

Its publication seemed to infuse additional bitterness into the feelings of Leibnitz, who descended to unfounded charges and empty threats. He had been privy counsellor to the Elector of Han over, before that prince was elevated to the British throne ; and in his correspondence, in 1715 and 1716, with the Abbe Conti, then at the court of George L, and with Caroline, Princess of Wales, he attacked the doctrines of the PRINCIPIA, and indirectly its author, in a manner very discreditable to himself, both as a learned and as an honourable man. His assaults, however, were triumphantly met; and, to the complete overthrow of his rival pretensions, Newton was induced to give the finishing blow. The verdict is universal and irreversible that the English preceded the German philosopher, by at least ten years, in the invention of fluxions. Newton could not have borrowed from Leibnitz ; but Leibnitz might have borrowed from Newton.

It seems rather to consist in a disposition of the sensorium to move the imagination strongly, and to be easily moved, both by the imagination and by the light, as often as bright objects are looked upon.\"J Though Newton had continued silent, yet his thoughts were by no means inactive upon the vast subject of the planetary mo tions. The idea of Universal Gravitation, first caught sight of, so to speak, in the garden at Woolsthorpe, years ago, had gradually expanded upon him. We find him, in a letter to Dr. Hooke, Secretary of the Royal Society, dated in November, 1679, pro posing to verify the motion of the earth by direct experiment, namely, by the observation of the path pursued by a body falling from a considerable height. He had concluded that the path would be spiral ; but Dr. Hooke maintained that it would be an eccentric ellipse iu vacuo, and an ellipti-spiral in a resisting me dium. Our author, aided by this correction of his error, and by 30 LIFE OF SIR ISAAC NEWTON. the discovery that a projectile would move in an elliptical orbil when under the influence of a force varying inversely as the square of the distance, was led to discover \" the theorem bj which he afterwards examined the ellipsis ;\" and to demonstrate the celebrated proposition that a planet acted upon by an attrac tive force varying inversely as the squares of the distances will describe an elliptical orbit, in one of whose foci the attractive force resides. When he was attending a meeting of the Royal Society, in June 1682, the conversation fell upon the subject of the measure ment of a degree of the meridian, executed by M. Picard, a French Astronomer, in 1679. Newton took a memorandum oi the result ; and afterward, at the earliest opportunity, computed from it the diameter of the earth : furnished with these new data, he resumed his calculation of 1666.
