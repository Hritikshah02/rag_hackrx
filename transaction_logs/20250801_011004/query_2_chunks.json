Two traditions were held in the family : one, that they were of Scotch extraction ; the other, that they came originally from Newton, in Lancashire, dwelling, for a time, however, at Westby, county of Lincoln, be fore the removal to and purchase of Woolsthorpe — about a hundred years before this memorable birth. The widow Newton was left with the simple means of a com fortable subsistence. The Woolsthorpe estate together with small one which she possessed at Sewstern, in Leicestershire, yield ed her an income of some eighty pounds ; and upon this limited sum, she had to rely chiefly for the support of herself, and the educa tion of her child. She continued his nurture for three years, when, marrying again, she confided the tender charge to the care of her own mother. Great genius is seldom marked by precocious development ; and young Isaac, sent, at the usual age, to two day schools at Skillington and Stoke, exhibited no unusual traits of character. In his twelfth year, he was placed at the public school at Gran- tham, and boarded at the house of Mr. Clark, an apothecary. But even in this excellent seminary, his mental acquisitions con tinued for a while unpromising enough : study apparentlv had no charms for him ; he was very inattentive, and ranked low in the school. One day, however, the boy immediately above our seem ingly dull student gave him a severe kick in the stomach ; Isaac, deeply affected, but with no outburst of passion, betook himself, with quiet, incessant toil, to his books ; he quickly passed above the offending classmate ; yet there he stopped not ; the strong spirit was, for once and forever, awakened, and, yielding to itb noble impulse, he speedily took up his position at the head of all. His peculiar character began now rapidly to unfold itself. Close application grew to be habitual. Observation alternated with reflection. \" A sober, silent, thinking lad,\" yet, the wisest and the kindliest, the indisputable leader",

On the contrary, in some ports, where to fill and empty the bays alternately the waters are with great violence forced in and out through shallow channels, the flood and ebb must be greater than ordinary ; as at Plymouth and Chepstow Bridge in England, at the mountains of St. Michael, and the town of Auranches, in Normandy, and at Combaia and Pegu in the East Indies. In these places the sea is hurried in and qjit with such violence, as sometimes to lay the shores under water, some times to leave them dry for many miles. Nor is this force of the influx and efflux to be broke till it has raised and depressed the waters to 30, 40, or 50 feet and above. And a like account is to be given of long and shal low channels or straits, such as the Mugellrniic straits, and those chan nels which environ England. The tide in such ports and straits, by the violence of the influx and efflux, is augmented above measure. But on such shores as lie towards the deep and open sea with a steep descent, where",

THE AUTHOR'S PREFACE SINCE the ancients (as we are told by Pappus), made great account oi the science of mechanics in the investigation of natural things : and the moderns, laying aside substantial forms and occult qualities, have endeav oured to subject the phenomena of nature to the laws of mathematics, I have in this treatise cultivated mathematics so far as it regards philosophy. The ancients considered mechanics in a twofold respect ; as rational, which proceeds accurately by demonstration ; and practical. To practical me chanics all the manual arts belong, from which mechanics took its name. Rut as artificers do not work with perfect accuracy, it comes to pass that mechanics is so distinguished from geometry, that what is perfectly accu rate is called geometrical , what is less",

Thus the apparent diameter of the moon, which in 1 684, a few days both before and after the sun's eclipse, was measured at the observatory of Paris 31' 30\", in the eclipse itself did not seem to exceed 30 or 30' 05\" ; and therefore the diameters of the planets are to be diminished when without the sun, and to be augmented when within it, by some seconds. But the errors seem to be less than usual in the mensurations that are made by the micrometer. So from the diameter of the shadow, determined by the eclipses of the satellites, Mr. Flamsted found that the semi- diameter of Jupiter was to the greatest elongation of the outmost satellite as 1 to 24,903. Wherefore since that elongation is 8' 13'', the diameter of Jupiter will be 39^-\" ; and, rejecting the scattered light, the diameter found by the micrometer 40\" or 41\" will be reduced to 39|-\" 5 and the diameter of Saturn 21\" is to be diminished by the like cor rection, and to be reckoned 20\", or something less. But (if I am not mis taken) the diameter of the sun, because of its stronger light, is to be dimin ished something more, and to be reckoned about 32', or 32' 61'. That bodies so different in magnitude should come so near to an analogy with their forces, is not without some mystery (p. 400). It may be that the remoter planets, for want of heat, have not those me tallic substances and ponderous minerals with which our earth abounds ; and that the bodies of Venus and Mercury, as they are more exposed to the sun's heat, are also harder baked, and more compact. For, from the experiment of the burning-glass, we see that the heat in creases with the density of light ; and this density increases in the recipro cal duplicate proportion of the distance from the sun ; from whence the san's heat in Mercury is proved to be sevenfold its heat in our summer seasons. But with this heat our water boils ; and those heavy fluids, quick silver and the spirit of vitriol, gently evaporate, as I have tried by the thermometer ; and therefore",

There was in him, if we may be allowed the expression, a WHOLE NESS of nature, which did not admit of such imperfections and weakness — the circle was too perfect, the law too constant, and the disturbing forces too slight to suffer scarcely any of those eccentricities which so interrupt and mar the movements of many bright spirits, rendering their course through the world more like that of the blazing meteor than that of the light and life-impart ing sun. In brief, the words GREATNESS and GOODNESS could not, humanly speaking, be more fitly employed than when applied as the pre-eminent characteristics of this pure, meek and vene rable sage. In the eightieth year of his age, Newton was seized with symptoms of stone in the bladder. His disease was pronounced incurable. He succeeded, however, by means of a strict regimen, and other precautions, in alleviating his complaint, and procuring long intervals of ease. His diet, always frugai, was now extremely temperate, consisting chiefly of broth, vegetables, and fruit, with, now and then, a little butcher meat. He gave up the use of his carriage, and employed, in its stead, when he went out, a chair. All invitations to dinner were declined ; and only small parties were received, occasionally, at his own house. In 1724 he wrote to the Lord Provost of Edinburgh, offering to contribute twenty pounds yearly toward the salary of Mr. Maclaurin, provided he accepted the assistant Professorship of Mathematics in the University of that place.

His wealth had become considerable by a prudent economy ; but he regarded money in no other light than as one of the means wherewith he had been intrusted to do good, and he faithfully employed it accordingly. He experienced, in spite of all his precautionary measures, a return of his complaint in the month of August, of the same year, 1 724, when he passed a stone the size of pea ; it came from him in two pieces, the one at the distance of two day.s from the other. Tolerable good health then followed for some months. In Janu ary, 1725, however, he was taken with a violent cough and inflam mation of the lungs. In consequence of this attack, he was pre vailed upon to remove to Kensington, where his health greatly improved. In February following, he was attacked in both feet with the gout, of the approach of which he had received, a few years before, a slight warning, and the presence of which now produced a very beneficial change in his general health. Mr. Conduit, his nephew, has recorded a curious conversation which took place, at or near this time, between himself and Sir Isaac. \"I was, on Sunday night, the 7th March, 1724-5, at Kensing ton, with Sir Isaac Newton, in his lodgings, just after he was out of a fit of the gout, which he had had in both of his feet, for the first time, in the eighty-third year of his age. He was better after it, and his head clearer and memory stronger than I had known them for some time. He then repeated to me, by way of dis course, very distinctly, though rather in answer to my queries, than in one continued narration, what he had often hinted to me before, viz. : that it was his conjecture (he would affirm nothing) that there was a sort of revolution in the heavenly bodies ; that the vapours and light, emitted by the sun, which had their sedi ment, as water and other matter, had gathered themselves, by degrees, into a body, and attracted more matter from the planets, and at last made a secondary planet (viz.",
