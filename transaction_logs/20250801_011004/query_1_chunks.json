We now arrive at the period when Newton permanently with drew from the seclusion of a collegiate, and entered upon a more active and public life. He was appointed Warden of the Mint, in 1695, through the influence of Charles Montague, Chancellor of the Exchequer, and afterward Earl of Halifax. The current roin of the nation had been adulterated and debased, and Mon tague undertook a re-coinage. Our author's mathematical and chemical knowledge proved eminently useful in accomplishing this difficult and most salutary reform. In 1699, he was pro moted to the Mastership of the Mint — an office worth twelve or fifteen hundred pounds per annum, and which he held during the remainder of his life. He wrote, in this capacity, an official Re port on the Coinage, which has been published ; he also prepared a Table of Assays of Foreign Coins, which was printed at the end of Dr. Arbuthnot's Tables of Ancient Coins, Weights, and Measures, in 1727. Newton retained his Professorship at Cambridge till 1703. But he had, on receiving the appointment of Master of the Mint, in 1699, made Mr. Whiston his deputy, with all the emoluments of the office ; and, on finally resigning, procured his nomination to the vacant Chair. In January 1697, John Bernouilli proposed to the most distin guished mathematicians of Europe two problems for solution. Leibnitz, admiring the beauty of one of them, requested the time for solving it to be extended to twelve months — twice the period originally named. The delay was readily granted. Newton, how ever, sent in, the day after he received the problems, a solution of them to the President of the Royal Society. Bernouilli obtained solutions from Newton, Leibinitz and the Marquis De L'Hopital ;",

The Punic Abbe had continued true to his promise of secrecy while he remained in England ; but no sooner did he reach Paris than he placed the manuscript into the hands of M. Freret, a learned antiquarian, who translated the work, and accompanied it with an attempted refutation of the leading points of the system.

Every particle of the stagnant water is equally pressed on all sides (by Prop. XIX., Book II), and, yielding to the pressure, tends always with an equal force, whether it descends through the hole in the bottom of the vessel, or gushes out in an horizontal direction through a hole in the side, or passes into a canal, and springs up from thence through a little hole made in the upper part of the canal. And it may not only be collected from reasoning, but is manifest also from the well-known experiments just mentioned, that the velocity with which the water runs out is the very same that is assigned in this Proposition. CASE 5. The velocity of the effluent water is the same, whether the figure of the hole be circular, or square, or triangular, or any other figure- equal to the circular ; for the velocity of the effluent water does not depend upon the figure of the hole, but arises from its depth below the plane KL.

If the lower part of the vessel ABDC B be immersed into stagnant water, and the height of the stagnant water above the bottom of the ves sel be GR, the velocity with which the water that is in the vessel will run out at the hole EF into the stagnant water will be the same which the water would acquire by falling from the height IR ; for the weight of all the water in the vessel that is below the superficies of the stagnant water will be sustained in equilibrio by the weight of the stagnant water, and therefore does riot at all accelerate the motion of the descending water in the vessel. This case will also appear by experiments, measuring the times in which the water will run out. COR. 1.

And therefore the tide is propagated through the ocean with a slower motion than it should be according to the course of the moon ; and this retardation is very necessary, that the sea at the same time may fall between Brazil and New France, and rise at the Canary islands, and on the coasts of Europe and Africa, and vice versa : for the sea can not rise in one place but by falling in another. And it is probable that the Pacific sea is agitated by the same laws : for in the coasts of Chili and Peru the highest flood is said to happen at the third lunar hour. But with what velocity it is thence propagated to the eastern coasts of Japan, the Philippine and other islands adjacent to China, I have not yet learned. Farther; it may happen (p. 418) that the tide may be propagated from the ocean through different channels towards the same port, and may pass quicker through some channels than through others, in which case the same tide, divided into two or more succeeding one another, may compound new motions of different kinds. Let us suppose one tide to be divided into two equal tides, the former whereof precedes the other by the space of six hours, and happens at the third or twenty-seventh hour from the appulse of the moon to the meridian of the port. If the moon at the time of this appulse to the meridian was in the equator, every six hours alternately there would arise equal floods, which, meeting with as many equal ebbs, would so balance one the other, that, for that day, the water wrould stag nate, and remain quiet. If the moon then declined from the equator, the tides in the ocean would be alternately greater and less, as was said; and from hence two greater and two lesser tides would be alternately propa gated towards that port.

A ihird edition of the PRINCIPIA appeared in 1726, with many changes and additions.

This gentleman enjoyed numerous opportunities of conversing with the aged and illustrious author. \" I found,\" says Pemberton, \" he had read fewer of the modern mathemati cians than one could have expected; but his own prodigious invention readily supplied him with what he might have an occa sion for in the pursuit of any subject he undertook. I have often LIFE OF SIR ISAAC NEWTON. 57 heard him censure the handling geometrical subjects ly algebraic calculations ; and his book of Algebra he called by the name of Universal Arithmetic, in opposition to the injudicious title of Geometry, which Descartes had given to the treatise, wherein he shows how the geometer may assist his invention by such kind of computations. He thought Huygens the most elegant of any mathematical writer of modern times, and the most just imitator of the ancients. Of their taste and form of demonstration, Sir Isaac always professed himself a great admirer. I have heard him even censure himself for not following them yet more closely than he did ; and speak with regret of his mistake at the begin ning of his mathematical studies, in applying himself to the works of Descartes and other algebraic writers, before he had considered the elements of Euclid with that attention which so excellent a writer deserves.\" \" Though his memory was much decayed,\" continues Dr. Pem- berton, \"he perfectly understood his own writings.\" And even this failure of memory, we would suggest, might have been more apparent than real, or, in medical terms, more the result of func tional weakness than organic decay. Newton seems never to have confided largely to his memory : and as this faculty mani fests the most susceptibility to cultivation ; so, in the neglect of due exercise, it more readily and plainly shows a diminution of its powers.
