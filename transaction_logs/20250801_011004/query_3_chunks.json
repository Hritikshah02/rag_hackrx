At or near this pe riod, other philosophers, as Sir Christopher Wren, Dr. Halley, and Dr. Hooke, were engaged in investigating the same subject ; but with no definite or satisfactory results. Dr. Halley, having seen, it is presumed, our author's propositions, went in August, 1684, to Cambridge to consult with him upon the subject. Newton assured him that he had brought the demonstration to perfection. In November, Dr. Halley received a copy of the work ; and, in the following month^ announced . it to the Royal Society, with the author's promise to have it entered upon their Register. Newton, subsequently reminded by the Society of his promise, proceeded in the diligent preparation of the work, and. though suffering an interruption of six weeks, transmitted the manuscript of the first book to London before the end of April. The work was entitled PHILOSOPHI/E NATURALIS PRINCIPIA MATHEMATICA, dedicated to the Royal Society, and presented thereto on the 28th of April, 1685-6. The highest encomiums were passed upon it ; and the council resolved, on the 19th of May, to print it at the expense of the Society, and under the di rection of Dr. Halley. The latter, a few days afterward, com municated these steps to Newton, who, in a reply, dated the 20th of June, holds the following language : — \" The proof you sent me I like very well. I designed the whole to consist of three books ; the second was finished last summer, being short, and only wants transcribing, and drawing the cuts fairly. Some new propositions I have since thought on, which I can as well let alone. The third wants the theory of comets. In autumn last, I spent two months in calculation to no purpose for want of a good method, which made me afterward return to the first book, and enlarge it with diverse propositions, some* relating to comets, others to other things found ouf last winter. The third I now design to sup press. Philosophy is such an impertinently litigious lady, that a man had as good be engaged in l«iw-suits as have to do with her. I found it so formerly, and now I",

Taking for granted that all bodies produced spectra of ^ jtial length, he dismissed all further consideration of the refracting instrument, and took up the principle of reflection. Rays of all colours, he found, were reflected regularly, so that the angle of reflection was equal to the angle of incidence, and hence he concluded that ojitical instruments might be brought to any degree of perfection imaginable, provided reflecting specula of the requisite figure and finish could be obtained. At this stage of his optical researches, he was forced to leave Cambridge on account of the plague which was then desolating England. He retired to Woolsthorpe. The old manor-house, in which he was born, was situated in a beautiful little valley, on the west side of the river Witham ; and here in the quiet home of his boyhood, 2 16 LIFE OF SIR ISAAC NEWTON. he passed his days in serene contemplation, while the stalking pestilence was hurrying its tens of thousands into undistinguisha • ble graves. Towards the close of a pleasant day in the early autumn of 1666, he was seated alone beneath a tree, in his garden, absorbed in meditation. He was a slight young man ; in the twenty-fourth year of his age ; his countenance mild and full of thought. For a century previous, the science of Astronomy had advanced with rapid strides. The human mind had risen from the gloom and bondage of the middle ages, in unparalleled vigour, to unfold the system, to investigate the phenomena, and to establish the laws of the heavenly bodies. Copernicus, Tycho Brahe, Kepler, Galileo, and others had prepared and lighted the way for him who was ta give to their labour its just value, and to their genius its true lustre. At his bidding isolated facts were to take order as parts of one harmonious whole, and sagacious conjectures grow luminous in the certain splendour of demonstrated truth. And this ablest man had come — was here. His mind, familiar with the knowledge of past effort, and its unequalled faculties develop ed in transcendant strength, was now moving on to the very threshold",

If the forces of the particles of which an attractive body is composed de crease, in. the recess of the attractive body, in a triplicate or more than a triplicate ratio of the distance from the particles, the attraction will be vastly stronger in the point of contact than when the attracting and attracted bodies are separated from each other, though by never so small an interval. For that the attraction is infinitely increased when the attracted corpus cle comes to touch an attracting sphere of this kind, appears, by the solu tion of Problem XLI, exhibited in ££e second and third Examples. The same will also appear (by comparing those Examples and Theorem XLI together) of attractions of bodies made towards concavo-convex orbs, whether the attracted bodies be placed without the orbs, or in the cavities within them. And by aiding to or taking from those spheres and orbs any at tractive matter any where without the place of contact, so that the attrac tive bodies may receive any assigned figure, the Proposition will hold good of all bodies universally.

Wherefore if the ring ad heres to the sphere, and communicates its motion to the sphere, by which its nodes or equinoctial points recede, the motion remaining in the ring will be to its former motion as 4590 to 489813; upon which account the motion of the equinoctial points will be diminished in the same propor tion. Wherefore the annual motion of the equinoctial points of the body, composed of both ring and sphere, will be to the motion 20° 11' 46\" as 1436 to 39343 and 4590 to 489813 conjunctly, that is, as 100 to 292369.

XXX), are in the several particles as the distances of those particles from the plane Q,R ; and by these forces the particles recede from that plane : and therefore (by Lem. II) if the matter of the ring was spread all over the surface of the sphere, after the fashion of the figure PupAPepl^, in order to make up that exterior part of the earth, the total force or power of all the particles to wheel about the earth round any diameter of the equator, and therefore to move the equinoctial points, would become less than before in the proportion of 2 to 5.
