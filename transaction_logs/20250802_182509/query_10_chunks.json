The Product Sheet may be amended in this regard from time to time with the mutual consent of both the\n                  Parties and any such amended annexure which is signed and agreed by the Parties will form an integral part of the Agreement,\n                  without there being a need to amend the Agreement.\n        10.2.

For\n                  facilitating remittance of the aforesaid fees, the Client agrees to submit such instructions, power of attorney, to the Bank, as\n                  the Bank may require from time to time.\n        10.4.     The Advisory Fees including Implementation Service Fees, if any, shall be exclusive of any taxes and the Client shall solely pay\n                  and bear any applicable taxes, levies, or duties with respect to the Services and any transactions undertaken pursuant to this\n                  Agreement.\n        10.5.     The Client agrees that the Advisor may revise and amend the Advisory Fees and Implementation Service Fees, if any, from\n                  time to time with the prior intimation to the Client.\n        10.6.",
