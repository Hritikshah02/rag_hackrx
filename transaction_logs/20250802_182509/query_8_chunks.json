Further, the investment objective would be to achieve this in the long\nterm through investments in investment opportunities that are a combination of equity, fixed income and alternate asset classes to\nachieve desired asset allocation for the portfolio.\n\nDescription of types of securities e.g. equity or debt, listed or unlisted, convertible instruments, etc.\nUnder this approach, the Portfolio Manager would primarily invest in equity oriented mutual fund schemes, listed securities including\nbut not limited to equity, preference, participating, non-participating, voting and/or non-voting shares, in warrants, options, equity\nlinked instruments, bonds, debentures, government securities, derivative instruments, units of alternate investment funds and/or other\npermissible securities/products in accordance with the Applicable Laws.\n\nBasis of selection of such types of securities as part of the investment approach\n▪  Discipline approach to asset allocation per the Investment Approach.\n▪  Investment in equity and equity oriented instruments like listed stocks, mutual funds, ETFs, options etc. Fixed income instruments like\n   bonds, debentures, mutual funds, ETFs also form a part of the universe of investment for the Portfolio Manager. Both open ended and\n   closed ended funds will be considered which include equity, fixed income, hybrid, thematic, index, ETF, arbitrage, offshore scheme/ETF\n   and gold schemes and any other categories that may emerge over time. The portfolio may also consider investments in InvITs/REITs,\n   bonds/debentures based on the prevailing market conditions and keeping the investor’s interests in mind to enhance relative risk\n   adjusted performances.\n▪  For any other asset class: instrument specific characteristics may be considered. For example: for parameters like correlation with\n   different asset classes, sensitivity to macroeconomic fluctuations, return trajectory etc. may be considered.\n\nAllocation of portfolio across types of securities –\n\n  Particulars                                                                                            Allocation\n\n  Equity and Equity Related Instruments: Listed Stocks/Open Ended Equity oriented mutual funds           0 to 100%\n  including ETF / Index / Equity Hybrid funds/ Global Equity Funds, etc.\n\nAppropriate benchmark to compare performance and basis for choice of benchmark:\nNifty Index\n\nIndicative tenure or investment horizon\nRecommended time horizon for effective portfolio returns as envisaged by the portfolio manager is minimum 3 (three) years.\n\nRisks associated with the investment approach\nBelow are select risks associated with the investment approach apart from those disclosed in Clause 6 of this Document. The risks may\naffect portfolio performance even though the Portfolio Manager may take measures to mitigate the same.\n\nRisk majorly related to equity and equity related Securities, interest rate risks and credit risks associated with fixed income securities.\nThis Investment Approach will be suitable for investors with moderate risk appetite.\n\n▪  The portfolio performance is subject to market risks and may lead to loss of capital during the tenure of the Portfolio. Investors with\n   an ability to take such risk shall be suitable for this investment approach.\n▪  The Portfolio may also be impacted by the interest rate movement, credit risks and liquidity risks, however, to the extent of the debt\n   fund exposure in the Portfolio.\n▪  Investments in mutual funds are subject to market risk and there is no assurance or guarantee of the objectives of the Portfolio\n   Investment approach being achieved.\n▪  The investment returns from the investment approach may be a function of mutual fund scheme selection and portfolio actions as\n   well as market conditions during the investment tenor of the portfolio Investment approach.\n▪  Past performance does not indicate the future performance of the investment approach.\n▪  Investors must keep in mind that the aforementioned statements/presentation cannot disclose all the risks and characteristics. The\n   Investors are requested to take into consideration all the risk factors including their financial condition, suitability to risk return profile\n   and the likes and take professional advice before investing.\n▪  There could be situations that the investment approach may not match the underlying benchmark. The Investors should note that the\n   risk factors of the underlying mutual fund schemes and other instruments where the portfolio manager will invest shall be applicable.\n▪  Allocation to cash/fixed income mutual funds would range between 40-60%. Hence, in periods of runaway equity returns and high\n   equity valuations, this investment approach may lag equity returns.\n▪  In a downward trending market, low allocation to debt may impact performance versus benchmark.",
