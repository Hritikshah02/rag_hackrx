      "question": "If an insured person takes treatment for arthritis at home because no hospital beds are available, under what circumstances would these expenses NOT be covered, even if a doctor declares the treatment was medically required?",
      "answer": "The expenses would not be covered if the home treatment does not meet the Domiciliary Hospitalisation definition—i.e., the patient could be transferred to a hospital or a hospital bed is available—so the condition is not one of the two listed circumstances (the patient is not unable to be moved to a hospital and there is no lack of hospital beds).",

      "answer": "The child meets the eligibility criteria as a covered dependent under the family‑floater definition, but because dental treatment is not listed among the covered base benefits and is excluded under the policy’s dental exclusions, the claim is not admissible and must be submitted for denial according to the policy’s claim process.",

      "answer": "The policy treats intra‑operative neuro‑monitoring as a modern treatment covered under the In‑patient Hospitalisation Expenses and reimburses ICU care (including ICU/ICU/HDU) on an “actual expenses incurred” basis, with no specified monetary cap, regardless of the city’s population size.",

      "answer": "The 3‑year‑old child may be added as a dependent because the policy’s family definition includes the employee’s legal spouse and children, but the insurer may refuse coverage if the child does not meet the eligibility criteria or if the addition is not made in accordance with the policy’s addition/deletion provisions.",

What is the claim eligibility for the newborn's treatment expenses, referencing definitions, exclusions, and newborn cover terms?",

Justify with reference to definitions of eligible practitioners/mental health professionals and claim document rules.",

      "answer": "Both the pre‑hospitalisation expenses incurred 18 days before admission and the post‑hospitalisation diagnostics and pharmacy expenses incurred 20 days after discharge are claimable because the policy provides “Pre‑hospitalisation Medical Expenses Cover – Actual Expenses Incurred (Number of days ‑ 30)” and “Post‑hospitalisation Medical Expenses Cover – Actual Expenses Incurred (Number of days ‑ 60)”.",
