If a tyre is punctured or damaged, it is advised to visit nearest tyre manufacture, Hero MotoCorp authorised dealer/workshop or the tyre repair shop who has expertise in repairing methods of tubeless tyre. You should not exceed 70 km/hour for the 1st 24 hours or 105 km/hour at any time thereafter. In addition, you may not be able to safely carry as much load as with a new tyre. If you decide to have a tyre replace be sure the wheel is balanced before you ride.Tyre replacementThe tyres that were installed on your vehicle were designed to match the performance capabilities of your vehicle and provide the best combination ofhandling, braking, durability and comfort. 62 WARNING ! ! • Operation with excessively worn tyres is hazardous and will adversely affect traction and handling. • Always use the size and type of tyres recommended in this owner's manual. • Under-inflation may result in the tyre slipping on or tyre coming off the rim. NOTE For repair and replacement of tyre it is advised to visit your Authorised Hero MotoCorp workshop. NOTE The imported tyre(s) if fitted without ISI mark; are in compliance of BIS standard and Central Motor Vehicle Rules 1989, as declared by the Tyre manufacturer. • Do not install a tube inside a tubeless tyre on this vehicle. Excessive heat buildup can cause the tube to burst. Important safety reminders • Use only tubeless tyres on this vehicle. The rims are designed for tubeless tyres, and during hard acceleration or braking, a tube- type tyre could slip on the rim and cause the tyre to rapidly deflate. • Check that all chassis nuts and bolts are tightened to correct torque values. • Check that all cotter pins, safety clips, hose clamps and cable stays are in place. NUTS, BOLTS & FASTENERS • Tighten bolts and nuts at regular interval shown in the maintenance schedule. BATTERY Refer to the safety precautions on (page 34).

TUBELESS TYRES To safely operate your vehicle, your tyres must be of the proper type and size, in good condition with adequate tread, and correctly inflated for the load you are carrying. The following pages give more detailed information on how and when to check the air pressure, how to inspect your tyres for damage, and what to do when your tyres need to be repaired or replaced. Generally, under-inflated tyres wear unevenly, adversely affect handling and are more likely to fail from being overheated. Keeping your tyres properly inflated provides the best combination of handling, tread life and riding comfort. Air pressure Under inflated tyres can also cause wheel damage in rocky terrain. 2 60 Over-inflated tyres make your vehicle ride harshly, are more prone to damage from road hazards, and wear unevenly. We recommend that you visually check your tyres before every ride and use a air pressure gauge (1) to measure air pressure at least once a month or any time you think the tyres pressure might be low.Front Rear2 1.75 kgf/cm(25 psi) 2 2.00 kgf/cm(29 psi)2 1.75 kgf/cm(25 psi) 2 2.30 kgf/cm(33 psi)Rider only Rider and Pillion Over inflation/Under inflation will affect the performance.

Inspection Look for: 1 at least three hours.
