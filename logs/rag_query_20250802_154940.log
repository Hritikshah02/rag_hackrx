2025-08-02 15:51:54,352 - ImprovedSemanticChunker - INFO - Final Answer: Newton explains that the mutual actions of planets upon one another are so small that they can be neglected, causing less disturbance than if the motions were performed about a sun at rest.

2025-08-02 15:51:55,384 - ImprovedSemanticChunker - INFO - Final Answer: Newton utilized the Method of Fluxions and the Binomial Theorem, precursors to calculus, and he did not use standard calculus notation because he favored the geometrical method over algebraic calculations.

2025-08-02 15:51:57,662 - ImprovedSemanticChunker - INFO - Final Answer: Newton uses centripetal force to explain orbital motion by demonstrating that it is the force directed towards a central body that retains other bodies in their orbits, preventing them from flying off in straight lines.

2025-08-02 15:51:59,957 - ImprovedSemanticChunker - INFO - Final Answer: Newton analyzes motion in resisting media by examining how the resistance arises from the fluid's inactivity and the pressure exerted by the fluid's compressed parts on a moving body.

2025-08-02 15:52:02,288 - ImprovedSemanticChunker - INFO - Final Answer: Newton's concept of absolute space and time, which are immutable and independent of external factors, serves as the framework for defining absolute motion as translation between these absolute places, thereby supporting his laws by providing a universal reference for motion and rest.
