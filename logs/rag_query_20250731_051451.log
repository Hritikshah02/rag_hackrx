--- Processing Question 7: What mathematical tools did Newton use in Principia that were precursors to calculus, and why didn't he use standard calculus notation? ---

2025-07-31 05:24:29,115 - ImprovedSemanticChunker - INFO - Final Answer: Newton used his method of fluxions, which predated standard calculus notation, because its algorithm and notation were not published until 1693 in Dr. Wallis's works.

2025-07-31 05:24:30,616 - ImprovedSemanticChunker - INFO - Final Answer: Newton uses centripetal force to explain orbital motion by demonstrating that a body subject to a force directed towards a central point will move in a specific trajectory, such as an ellipse, with predictable velocity and position over time.

2025-07-31 05:24:32,001 - ImprovedSemanticChunker - INFO - Final Answer: Newton explains that resistance in fluids is proportional to the square of the velocity, and this resistance is considered as a motive force that can be added to or subtracted from the body's motion, or as a centrifugal force depending on whether the body is urged more or less powerfully by the medium's centripetal force.

--- Processing Question 10: In what way does Newton's notion of absolute space and time differ from relative motion, and how does it support his laws? ---

2025-07-31 05:24:33,211 - ImprovedSemanticChunker - INFO - Final Answer: Newton distinguishes absolute space and time from relative motion by defining them as independent of any external observer or object's movement, which forms the foundation for his laws of motion by providing a universal reference frame.
