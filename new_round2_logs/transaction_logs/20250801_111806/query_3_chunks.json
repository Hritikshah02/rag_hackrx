And the same thing is to be said of Saturn in respect of its satellites, and of our earth in re spect of the moon, as appears from Cor. II and III, Prop. LXV. Arid, therefore, at equal distances, the actions of the centripetal force are equal upon all the planets in proportion of their bodies, or of the quantities of matter in their several bodies; and for the same reason must be the same upon all the particles of the same size of which the planet is composed ; for if the action was greater upon some sort of particles than upon others than in proportion to their quantity of matter, it would be also greater or less upon the whole planets not in proportion to the quantity only, but like wise of the sort of the matter more copiously found in one and more sparingly in another. In such bodies as are found on our earth of very different sorts, I exam ined this analogy with great accuracy (p. 343, 344). If the action of the circum-terrestrial force is proportional to the bodies to be moved, it will (by the Second Law of Motion) move them with equal velocity in equal times, and will make all bodies let fall to descend through equal spaces in equal times, and all bodies hung by equal threads to vibrate in equal times. If the action of the force was greater, the times would be less ; if that was less, these would be greater. But it has been long ago observed by others, that (allowance being made for the small resistance of the air) all bodies descend through equal spaces 526 THE SYSTEM OF THE WORLD. in equal times ; and, by the help of pendulums, that equality of tim-es may be distinguished to great exactness. 1 tried the thing",

For the differences of the motions tending towards the same parts, and the sums of those that tend towards contrary parts, are, at first (by sup position), in both cases the same ; and it is from those sums and differences that the collisions and impulses do arise with which the bodies mutually impinge one upon another. Wherefore (by Law II), the effects of those collisions will be equal in both cases ; and therefore the mutual motions of the bodies among themselves in the one case will remain equal to the mutual motions of the bodies among themselves in the other. A clear proof of which we have from the experiment of a ship ; where all motions happen after the same manner, whether the ship is at rest, or is carried uniformly forwards in a right line. COROLLARY VI. If bodies, any how moved among themselves, are urged in the direct-ton of parallel lines by equal accelerative forces, they will all continue to move among themselves, after the same manner as if they had been urged by no such forces. For these forces acting equally (with respect to the quantities of the DO dies to be moved), and in the direction of parallel lines, will (by Law II) move all the bodies equally (as to velocity), and therefore will never pro duce any change in the positions or motions of the bodies among themselves. SCHOLIUM. Hitherto I have laid down such principles as have been received by math ematicians, and are confirmed by abundance of experiments. By the first two Laws and the first two Corollaries, Galileo discovered that the de scent of bodies observed the duplicate ratio of the time, and that the mo tion of projectiles was in the curve of a parabola; experience agreeing with both, unless so far as these motions are a little retarded by the re sistance of the air. When a body is falling, the uniform force of its gravity acting equally, impresses, in equal particles of time, equal forces upon that body, and therefore generates equal velocities; and in the whole time impresses a whole force, and generates a whole velocity proportional to the time. And the spaces described in proportional times are as the velocities and the times conjunctly ; that is, in a duplicate ratio of the times. And when a body is thrown upwards, its uniform gravity im presses forces and takes off velocities proportional to the times ; and the times of ascending to the greatest heights are",

As if the body A by its motion of pio- jection alone could describe in a given time the right line AB, and with its motion of falling alone could describe in the same time the altitude AC ; complete the paralello- gram ABDC, and the body by that compounded motion will at the end of the time be found in the place D ; and the curve line AED, which that body describes, will be a parabola, to which the right line AB will be a tangent in A ; and whose ordinate BD will be as the square of the line AB. On the same Laws and Corollaries depend those things which have been demon strated concerning the times of the vibration of pendulums, and are con firmed by the daily experiments of pendulum clocks. By the same, to gether with the third Law, Sir Christ. Wren, Dr. Wallis, and Mr. Huv- gens, the greatest geometers of our times, did severally determine the rules of the congress and reflexion of hard bodies, and much about the same time communicated their discoveries to the Royal Society, exactly agreeing among themselves as to those rules. Dr. Wallis, indeed, was something more early in the publication ; then followed Sir Christopher Wren, and, lastly, Mr. Huygens. But Sir Christopher Wren confirmed the truth of the thing before the Royal Society by the experiment of pendulums, which Mr. Mariottc soon after thought fit to explain in a treatise entirely upon that subject. But to bring this experiment to an accurate agreement with",

I provided two equal wooden boxes. I filled the one with wood, and suspended an equal weight of gold (as exactly as I could) in the centre of oscillation of the other. The boxes, hung by equal threads of 11 feet, made a couple of pendulums perfectly equal in weight and fig ure, and equally exposed to the resistance of the air : and, placing the one by the other, I observed them to play together forwards and backwards for a long while, with equal vibrations. And therefore (by Cor. 1 and VI, Prop. XXIV. Book II) the quantity of matter in the gold was to the quan tity of matter in the wood as the action of the motive force upon all the gold to the action of the same upon all the wood ; that is, as the weight of the one to the weight of the other. And by these experiments, in bodies of the same weight, could have dis covered a difference of matter less than the thousandth part of the whole. Since the action of the centripetal force upon the bodies attracted is, at equal distances, proportional to the quantities of matter in those bodies, reason requires that it should be also proportional to the quantity of mat ter in the body attracting. For all action is mutual, and (p. 83, 93. by the Third Law of Motion) makes the bodies mutually to approach one to the other, and therefore must be the same in both bodies. It is true that we may consider one body as attracting, another as attracted; but this distinction is more mathematical than natural. The attraction is really common of either to other, and therefore of the same kind in both. And hence it is that the attractive force is found in both. The sun at tracts Jupiter and the other planets ; Jupiter attracts its satellites ; and, for the same reason,",

Hvery body perseveres in its state of rest, or of uniform motion in a ri^ht line, unless it is compelled to change that state by forces impressed thereon. PROJECTILES persevere in their motions, so far as they are not retarded by the resistance of the air, or impelled downwards by the force of gravity A top, whose parts by their cohesion are perpetually drawn aside from rectilinear motions, does not cease its rotation, otherwise than as it is re tarded by the air. The greater bodies of the planets and comets, meeting with less resistance in more free spaces, preserve then jDotions both pro gressive and circular for a much longer time. LAW II. The alteration of motion is ever proportional to the motive force imp reus ed ; and is made in the direction of the right line in. which that force is impressed. If any force generates a motion, a double force will generate double the motion, a triple force triple the motion, whether that force be impressed altogether and at once, or gradually and successively. And this motion (being always directed the same way with the generating force), if the body moved before, is added to or subducted from the former motion, according as they directly conspire with or are directly contrary to each other ; or obliquely joined, when they are oblique, so as to produce a new motion compounded from the determination of both.

Join SC, and, because s SB and Cc are parallel, the triangle SBC will be equal to the triangle SBc, and therefore also to the triangle SAB. By the like argument, if the centripetal force acts successively in C, D, E. &c., and makes the body, in each single particle of time, to describe the right lines CD, DE, EF7 &c., they will all lie in the same plane : and the triangle SCD will be equal to the triangle SBC, and SDE to SCD, and SEF to SDE.
