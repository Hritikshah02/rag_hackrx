XXXII and XXXIII) in the duplicate ratio of the velocity, in order to preserve the re sistance in the same duplicate ratio. But because this is not done, the globes that move swiftly are not so much pressed at their hinder parts as the others; and by the defect of this pressure it comes to pass that their resistance is a little greater than in a duplicate ratio of their velocity. So that the theory agrees with the phenomena of bodies falling in water It remains that we examine the phenomena of bodies falling in air. EXPER. 13. From the top of St. Paul's Church in London, in Juiib 1710, there w.ere let fall together two glass globes, one full of quicksilver, the other of air; and in their fall they described a height of 220 English feet. A wooden table was suspended upon iron hinges on one sidi> and the other side of the same was supported by a wooden pin. The twn globes lying upon this table were let fall together by pulling out the pin bj means of an iron wire reaching from thence quite down to the ground ; s< 352 THE MATHEMATICAL PRINCIPLES [BOOK II, that, the pin being removed, the table, which had then no support but the iron hinges, fell downward, and turning round upon the hinges, gave leave to the globes to drop off from it. At the same instant, with the same pull of the iron wire that took out the pin, a pendulum oscillating to seconds was let go, and began to oscillate. The diameters and weights of the globes, and their times of falling, are exhibited in the following table. 'ike globes filled with mere Weights. DiaiTV ters ury. Times i, falling.

And these were the last days of Isaac Newton. Thus closed the career of one of earth's greatest and best men. His mission was fulfilled. Unto the Giver, in many-fold addition, the talents were returned. While it was yet day he had worked ; and for the night that quickly cometh he was not unprepared.

His body was placed in Westminster Abbey, with the state and ceremonial that usually attended the interment of the most distinguished. In 1731, his relatives, the inheritors of his personal estate, erected a monument to his memory in the most conspicu ous part of the Abbey, which had often been refused by the dean and chapter to the greatest of England's nobility. During the same year a medal was struck at the Tower in his honour ; arid, in 1755, a full-length statue of him, in white marble, admirably executed, by Roubiliac, at the expense of Dr. Robert Smith, was erected in the ante-chamber of Trinity College, Cambridge. There is a painting executed in the glass of one of the windows of the same college, made pursuant to the will of Dr. Smith, who left five hundred pounds for that purpose. Newton left a personal estate of about thirty-two thousand pounds. It was divided among his four nephews and four nieces of the half blood, the grand-children of his mother, by the Reve rend Mr. Smith. The family estates of Woolsthorpe arid Sustern fell to John Newton, the heir-at-law, whose great grand-father was Sir Isaac's uncle. Before his death he made an equitable distribution of his two other estates : the one in Berkshire to the sons and daughter of a brother of Mrs. Conduit ; and the other, at Kensington, to Catharine, the only daughter",

The parts so going, and in their going condensed, are pulses, by reason of the progressive motion with which they strike obstacles in their way; and therefore the successive pulses produced by a tremulous body will be propagated in rectilinear directions ; and that at nearly equal distances from each other, because of the equal intervals of time in which the body, by its several tremors produces the several pulses. And though the parts of the tremulous body go and return .n some certain and deter minate direction, yet the pulses propagated from thence through the medium will dilate themselves towards the sides, by the foregoing Proposition : anc7 360 THE MATHEMATICAL PRINCIPLES [BoOK 11 will be propagated on all sides from that tremulous body, as from a com mon centre, in superficies nearly spherical and concentrical. An example of this we have in waves excited by shaking a finger in water, which proceed not only forward and backward agreeably to the motion of the finger, but spread themselves in the manner of concentrical circles all round the finger, and are propagated on every side. For the gravity of the water supplies the place of elastic force. Case 2. If the medium be not elastic, then, because its parts cannot be condensed by the pressure arising from the vibrating parts of the tremulous body, the motion will be propagated in an instant towards the parts where the medium yields most easily, that is; to the parts which the tremulous body would otherwise leave vacuous behind it. The case is the same with that of a body projected in any medium whatever. A medium yielding to projectiles does not recede in infinitum, but with a circular motion comes round to the spaces which the body leaves behind it. Therefore as often as a tremulous body tends to any part, the medium yielding to it comes round in a circle to the parts which the body leaves ; and as often as the body returns to the first place, the medium will be driven from the place it came round to, and return to its original place. And though the tremulous bod} be not firm and hard, but every way flexible, yet if it continue of a given magnitude, since it cannot impel the medium by its treniors any where without yielding to it somewhere else, the medium receding from the parts of the body where it is pressed will always come round in a circle to the parts that yield to it.",

LEMMA II. The moment of any genitum is equal to the moments of each of the gen- eratinrr sides drawn into the indices of the powers of those sides, and into their co-efficients continually. I call any quantity a genitum which is not made by addition or sub- duction of divers parts, but is generated or produced in arithmetic by the multiplication, division, or extraction of the root of any terms whatsoever : in geometry by the invention of contents and sides, or of the extremes and means of proportionals. Quantities of this kind are products, quotients, roots, rectangles, squares, cubes, square and cubic sides, and the like. These quantities I here consider as variable and indetermined, and increas ing or decreasing, as it were, by a perpetual motion or flux ; and I under stand their momentaneous increments or decrements by the name of mo ments ; so that the increments may be esteemed as added or affirmative moments ; and the decrements as subducted or negative ones. But take care not to look upon finite particles as such. Finite particles are not moments, but the very quantities generated by the moments. We are to conceive them as the just nascent principles of finite magnitudes. Nor do we in this Lemma regard the magnitude of the moments, but their firsf 262 THE MATHEMATICAL PRINCIPLES [BoOK 11 proportion, as nascent. It will be the same thing, if, instead of moments, we use either the velocities of the increments and decrements (which may also be called the motions, mutations, and fluxions of quantities), or any finite quantities proportional to those velocities. The co-efficient of any generating side is the quantity which arises by applying the genitum to ihat side. Wherefore the sense of the Lemma is, that if the moments of any quan tities A, B, C, &c., increasing or decreasing by a perpetual flux, or the velocities of the mutations which are proportional to them, be called a, 6, r, (fee., the moment or mutation of the generated rectangle AB will be «B -h b A ; the moment of the generated content ABC will be aBC -",
