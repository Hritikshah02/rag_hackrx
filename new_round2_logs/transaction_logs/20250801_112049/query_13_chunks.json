SEC. VII.] OF NATURAL PHILOSOPHY. 331 SCHOLIUM. I have exhibited in this Proposition the resistance and retardation of spherical projectiles in mediums that are not continued, and shewn that this resistance is to the force by which the whole motion of the globe may be destroyed or produced in the time in which the globe can describe two thirds of its diameter, with a velocity uniformly continued, as the density of the medium to the density of the globe, if so be the globe and the particles of the medium be perfectly elastic, and are endued with the utmost force of reflexion ; and that this force, where the globe and particles of the medium are infinitely hard and void of any reflecting force, is diminished one half. But in continued mediums, as water, hot oil, and quicksilver, the globe as it passes through them does not immediately strike against all the parti cles of the fluid that generate the resistance made to it, but presses only the particles that lie next to it, which press the particles beyond, which press other particles, and so on ; and in these mediums the resistance is di minished one other half. A globe in these extremely fluid mediums meets with a resistance that is to the force by which its whole motion may be destroyed or generated in the time wherein it can describe, with that mo tion uniformly continued, eight third parts of its diameter, as the density of the medium to the density of the globe. This I shall endeavour to shew in what follows. PROPOSITION XXXVI. PROBLEM VIII. To define the motion of water running out of a cylindrical vessel through a hole made at the bottom.

Therefore if out of an equal number of par ticles there be compounded any equal portions of time, the velocities at the beginning of those times will be as terms in a continued progression, which are taken by intervals, omitting every where an equal number of interme diate terms. But the ratios of these terms are compounded of the equaj ratios of the intermediate terms equally repeated, and therefore are equal Therefore the velocities, being proportional to those terms, are in geomet rical progression.

For if that area, by the motion of the point D, be uniform ly increased in the same manner as the time, the right line DC will de crease in a geometrical ratio in the same manner as the velocity ; and the parts of the right line AC, described in equal times, will decrease in the same ratio.

Ff a body is resisted in the duplicate ratio of its velocity, and moves by its innate force only through a similar medium; and the times be taken in a geometrical progression, proceeding from less to greater terms : I say, that the velocities at the beginning of each of the times are in the same geometrical progression inversely ; and that the spaces are equal, which are described in each of the times. For since the resistance of the medium is proportional to the square of the velocity, and the decrement of the velocity is proportional to the resist ance : if the time be divided into innumerable equal particles, the squares of the velocities at the beginning of each of the times will be proportional to the differences of the same velocities. Let those particles of time be AK, KL, LM, &c., taken in the right line CD; and erect the perpendiculars AB, Kk, L/, Mm, &c., meeting the hyperbola BklmG, described with the centre C, and the rectangular asymptotes CD, CH. in B, kj I, m, (fee. ; then AB will be to K",

That resistance which arises from the elasticity, tenacity, and friction of its parts, may be thus investigated.

But it is suf ficient to have cleared the way to this speculation in Prop. VIII and IX foregoing, and their Corollaries. For in those Propositions, instead of the uniform resistance made to an ascending body arising from its gravity, one may substitute the uniform resistance which arises from the tenacity of the medium, when the body moves by its vis insita alone ; and when the body ascends in a right line, add this uniform resistance to the force of gravity, and subduct it when the body descends in a right line.

If the resistance in the arc B were to the resistance in the arc A as AB to AA, the times in the arcs A and B would be equal (by the last Prop.) Therefore the resistance AA in the arc A, or AB in the arc B, causes the excess of the time in the arc A above the time in a non-resisting medium ; and the resistance BB causes the excess of the time in the arc B above the time in a non-resisting medium.

The shorter oscillations are more isochronal, and very short ones are performed nearly in the same times as in a non-resisting medium. But the times of those which are performed in greater arcs are a little greater, because the resistance in the descent of the body, by which the time is prolonged, is greater, in proportion to the length described in the descent than the resistance in the subsequent ascent, by which the time is contracted. But the time of the oscillations, both short arid long, seems to be prolonged in some measure by the motion of the medium. For retard ed bodies are resisted somewhat less in proportion to the velocity, and ac celerated bodies somewhat more than those that proceed uniformly forwards ; SEC. VI.] OF NATURAL PHILOSOPHY. 307 because the medium, by the motion it has received from the bodies, going forwards the same way with them, is more agitated in the former case, and less in the latter ; and so conspires more or less with the bodies moved.
