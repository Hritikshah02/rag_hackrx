Now if that water becomes fluid, it will somewhat increase the resistance. But in these Propositions that increase is so small, that it may be neglected, because the convex superfi cies of the globe produces the very same effect almost as the congelation of the water. PROPOSITION XL. PROBLEM IX. To find by phenomena the resistance of a globe moving through a per fectly fluid compressed medium. Let A be the weight of the globe in vacua, B its weight in the resisting medium, D the diameter of the globe. F a space which is to f D as the den sity of the globe to the density of the medium, that is, as A to A — B, G the time in which the globe falling with the weight B without resistance describes the space P, and H the velocity which the body acquires by that fall. Then H will be the greatest velocity with which the globe can pos sibly descend with the weight B in the resisting medium, by Cor. 2, Prop XXXVIII ; and the resistance which the globe meets with, when descend ing with that velocity, will be equal to its weight B ; and the resistance it meets with in any other velocity will be to the weight B in the duplicate ra tio of that velocity to the greatest velocity H, by Cor. 1, Prop. XXXVIII. This is the resistance that arises from the inactivity of the matter of the fluid. That resistance which arises from the elasticity, tenacity, and friction of its parts, may be thus investigated. Let the globe be let fall so that it may descend in the fluid by the weight B ; and let P be the time of falling, and let that time be expressed in sec onds, if the time G be given in seconds.

But it is suf ficient to have cleared the way to this speculation in Prop. VIII and IX foregoing, and their Corollaries. For in those Propositions, instead of the uniform resistance made to an ascending body arising from its gravity, one may substitute the uniform resistance which arises from the tenacity of the medium, when the body moves by its vis insita alone ; and when the body ascends in a right line, add this uniform resistance to the force of gravity, and subduct it when the body descends in a right line. One might also go on to the motion of bodies which are resisted in part uni formly, in part in the ratio of the velocity, and in part in the duplicate ratio of the same velocity. And I have opened a way to this in Prop. XIII and XIV foregoing, in which the uniform resistance arising from the tenacity of the medium may be substituted for the force of gravity, or be compounded with it as before.

SEC. VII.] OF NATURAL PHILOSOPHY. 331 SCHOLIUM. I have exhibited in this Proposition the resistance and retardation of spherical projectiles in mediums that are not continued, and shewn that this resistance is to the force by which the whole motion of the globe may be destroyed or produced in the time in which the globe can describe two thirds of its diameter, with a velocity uniformly continued, as the density of the medium to the density of the globe, if so be the globe and the particles of the medium be perfectly elastic, and are endued with the utmost force of reflexion ; and that this force, where the globe and particles of the medium are infinitely hard and void of any reflecting force, is diminished one half. But in continued mediums, as water, hot oil, and quicksilver, the globe as it passes through them does not immediately strike against all the parti cles of the fluid that generate the resistance made to it, but presses only the particles that lie next to it, which press the particles beyond, which press other particles, and so on ; and in these mediums the resistance is di minished one other half. A globe in these extremely fluid mediums meets with a resistance that is to the force by which its whole motion may be destroyed or generated in the time wherein it can describe, with that mo tion uniformly continued, eight third parts of its diameter, as the density of the medium to the density of the globe. This I shall endeavour to shew in what follows. PROPOSITION XXXVI. PROBLEM VIII. To define the motion of water running out of a cylindrical vessel through a hole made at the bottom.

But, yet, that the resistance of bodies is in the ratio of the velocity, is more a mathematical hypothesis than a physical one.

Let us, therefore, see what motions arise from this law of resistance. SECTION II. 'If the motion of bodies that are resisted in tfie duplicate ratio of their velocities. PROPOSITION V. THEOREM III. Ff a body is resisted in the duplicate ratio of its velocity, and moves by its innate force only through a similar medium; and the times be taken in a geometrical progression, proceeding from less to greater terms : I say, that the velocities at the beginning of each of the times are in the same geometrical progression inversely ; and that the spaces are equal, which are described in each of the times. For since the resistance of the medium is proportional to the square of the velocity, and the decrement of the velocity is proportional to the resist ance : if the time be divided into innumerable equal particles, the squares of the velocities at the beginning of each of the times will be proportional to the differences of the same velocities.

Anno 1719, in the month of July, Dr. Desaguliers made some experiments of this kind again, by forming hogs' bladders into spheri cal orbs ; which was done by means of a concave wooden sphere, which the bladders, being wetted well first, were put into. After that being blown full of air. they were obliged to fill up the spherical cavity that contained them ; and then, when dry, were taken out. These were let fall from the lantern on the top of the cupola of the same church, namely, from a height of 272 feet ; and at the same moment of time there was let fall a leaden globe, whose weight was about 2 pounds troy weight. And in the mean time some persons standing in the upper part of the church where the globes were let fall observed the whole times of falling ; and others stand ing on the ground observed the differences of the times between the fall of the leaden weight and the fall of the bladder. The times were measured by pendulums oscillating to half seconds. And one of those that stood upon the ground had a machine vibrating four times in one second ; and another had another machine accurately made with a pendulum vibrating four times in a second also. One of those also who stood at the top of the church had a like machine ; and these instruments were so contrived, that their motions could be stopped or renewed at pleasure. Now the leaden globe fell in about four seconds and i of time; and from the addition of this time to the difference of time above spoken of, was collected the \\Vhole time in",
