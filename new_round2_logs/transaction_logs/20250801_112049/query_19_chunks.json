VI I.] OF NATURAL PHILOSOPHY. 323 SECTION VII. Of the, motion of fluids, and the resistance made to projected bodies. PROPOSITION XXXII. THEOREM XXVI. Suppose two similar systems of bodies consisting of an equal number of particles, and let the correspondent particles be similar and propor tional, each in, one system to each in the other, and have a like situa tion among themselves, and the same given ratio of density to each other ; and let them begin to move anwng themselves in proportional times, and with like motions (that is, those in one system among one another, and those in the other among one another). And if the par ticles that are in the same system do not touch otte another, except ir the moments of reflexion ; nor attract, nor repel each other, except with accelerativeforc.es that are as the diameters of the correspondent parti cles inversely, and the squares of the velocities directly ; I say, that the particles of those systems will continue to move among themselves wit It like motions and in proportional times. Like bodies in like situations are said to be moved among themselves with like motions and in proportional times, when their situations at the end of those times are always found alike in respect of each other ; as sup pose we compare the particles in one system with the correspondent parti cles in the other. Hence the times will be proportional, in which similar and proportional parts of similar figures will be described by correspondent particles. Therefore if we suppose two systems of this kind; the corre spondent particles, by reason of the similitude of the motions at their beginning, will continue to be moved with like motions, so long as they move without meeting one another ; for if they are acted on by no forces, they will go on uniformly in right lines, by the 1st Law. But if they do agitate one another with some certain forces, and those forces are as the diameters of the correspondent particles inversely and the squares of the velocities directly, then, because the particles are in like situations, and their forces are proportional, the whole forces with which correspondent particles are agitated,",

For conceive a plane to p«ass through the axis of the globe, and to revolve with a contrary mo tion ; and suppose the sum of the time of this revolution and of the revolu tion of the globe to be to the time of the revolution of the globe as the square of the semi-diameter of the vessel.to the square of the semi-diameter of the globe ; and the periodic times of the parts of the fluid in respect of this plane will be as the squares of their distances from the centre of the globe. COR. 10. Therefore if the vessel move about the same axis with the globe, or with a given velocity about a different one, the motion of the fluid will be given. For if from the whole system we take away the angular motion of the vessel, all the motions will remain the same among themselves as before, by Cor. 8, and those motions will be given by Cor. 9. COR. 11. If the vessel and the fluid are quiescent, and the globe revolves with an uniform motion, that motion will be propagated by degrees through the whole fluid to the vessel, and the vessel will be carried round by it, unless violently detained ; and the fluid and the vessel will be continually accelerated till their periodic times become equal to the periodic times of the globe. If the vessel be either withheld by some force, or revolve with any constant and uniform motion, the medium will come by little and little to the state of motion defined in Cor. 8, 9, 10, nor will it ever perse vere in any other state. But if then the forces, by which the globe and vessel revolve with certain motions, should cease, and the whole system be left to act according to the mechanical laws, the vessel and globe, by means of the intervening fluid, will act upon each other, and will continue to propagate their motions",

But it is suf ficient to have cleared the way to this speculation in Prop. VIII and IX foregoing, and their Corollaries. For in those Propositions, instead of the uniform resistance made to an ascending body arising from its gravity, one may substitute the uniform resistance which arises from the tenacity of the medium, when the body moves by its vis insita alone ; and when the body ascends in a right line, add this uniform resistance to the force of gravity, and subduct it when the body descends in a right line. One might also go on to the motion of bodies which are resisted in part uni formly, in part in the ratio of the velocity, and in part in the duplicate ratio of the same velocity. And I have opened a way to this in Prop. XIII and XIV foregoing, in which the uniform resistance arising from the tenacity of the medium may be substituted for the force of gravity, or be compounded with it as before.

XXXII and XXXIII) in the duplicate ratio of the velocity, in order to preserve the re sistance in the same duplicate ratio. But because this is not done, the globes that move swiftly are not so much pressed at their hinder parts as the others; and by the defect of this pressure it comes to pass that their resistance is a little greater than in a duplicate ratio of their velocity. So that the theory agrees with the phenomena of bodies falling in water It remains that we examine the phenomena of bodies falling in air. EXPER. 13. From the top of St. Paul's Church in London, in Juiib 1710, there w.ere let fall together two glass globes, one full of quicksilver, the other of air; and in their fall they described a height of 220 English feet.

By this means the water will run perpendicularly out at the lower hole ; and the quantity of the water running out will be, according to the magnitude 334 THE MATHEMATICAL PRINCIPLES [BOOK 11 of this last hole, the same, very nearly, which the solution of the Problem requires. The space included between the two planes and the falling stream may be considered as the bottom of the vessel. But, to make the solution more simple and mathematical, it is better to take the lower plane alone for the bottom of the vessel, and to suppose that the water which flowed through the ice as through a funnel, and ran out of the vessel through the hole EF made in the lower plane, preserves its motion continually, and that the ice continues at rest. Therefore in what follows let ST be the diame ter of a circular hole described from the centre Z, and let the stream run out of the vessel through that hole, when the water in the vessel is all fluid. And let EP be the diameter of the hole, which the stream, in fall ing through, exactly fills up, whether the water runs out of the vessel by that upper hole ST, or flows through the middle of the ice in the vessel, as through a funnel. And let the diameter of the upper hole ST be to the diameter of the lower EF as about 25 to 21, and let the perpendicular di& tance between the planes of the holes be equal to the diameter of the lesser hole EF. Then the velocity of the water downwards, in running out of the vessel through the hole ST, will be in that hole the same that a body may acquire by falling from half the height IZ ; and the velocity of both the falling streams will be in the hole EF, the same which a body would acquire by falling from the Avhole height IG. CASE 2. If the hole EF be not in the middle of the bottom of the ves sel, but in some other part thereof, the water will still run out with the same velocity as before, if the magnitude of the hole be the same. For though an heavy body takes a longer time in descending to the same depth, by an oblique line, than by a perpendicular line, yet in both cases it acquires in its descent the same velocity ; as",
