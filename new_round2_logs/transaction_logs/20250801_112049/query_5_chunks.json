Now if that water becomes fluid, it will somewhat increase the resistance.

To describe a trajectory that shall pass through two given points, and touch three right lines given by position. Through the concourse of any two of the tangents one with the other, and the concourse of the third tangent with the right line which passes through the two given points, draw an indefinite right line ; and, taking this line for the first ordinate radius, transform the figure by the preceding Lemma into a new figure.

In the quadratures the sun will raise the waters which the moon dcpresseth. and depress the waters which the moon raiseth ; and from the difference of their forces the smallest of all tides will follow.

Out of the syzygies and quadratures the greatest tide which by the single force of the moon ought to fall out at the third lunar hour, and by the single force of the sun at the third solar hour, by the compounded forces of both must fall out in an intermediate time that ap proaches nearer to the third hour of the moon than to that of the sun: and, therefore, while the moon is passing from the syzygies to the quadra tures, during which time the third hour of the sun precedes the third of the moon, the greatest tide will precede the third lunar hour, and that by the greatest interval a little after the octants of the moon ; and by like intervals the greatest tide will follow the third lunar hour, while the moon is passing from the quadratures to the syzygies. But the effects of the luminaries depend upon their distances from the earth ; for when they are less distant their effects are greater, and when more distant their effects are less, and that in the triplicate proportion of their apparent diameters.

A fluid must be compressed to become continued; it must be continued and non-elastic, that all the pressure arising from its compression may be propagated in an instant ; and so, acting equally upon all parts of the body moved, may produce no change of the resistance. The pressure arising from the motion of the body is spent in generating a motion in the parts of the fluid, and this creates the resistance. But the pressure arising from the compression of the fluid, be it ever so forcible, if it be propagated in an instant, generates no motion in the parts of a continued fluid, produces no change at all of motion therein ; and therefore neither augments nor les sens the resistance. This is certain, that the action of the fluid arising from the compression cannot be stronger on the hinder parts of the body moved than on its fore parts, and therefore cannot lessen the resistance de scribed in this proposition. And if its propagation be infinitely swifter than the motion of the body pressed, it will not be stronger on the fore parts than on the hinder parts. But that action will be infinitely swifter, and propagated in an instant, if the fluid be continued and non- elastic. COR. 1.
