Therefore the use of this Corollary spreads far and wide, and by that diffusive extent the truth thereof is farther con firmed. For on what has been said depends the whole doctrine of mechan ics variously demonstrated by different authors. For from hence are easily deduced the forces of machines, which are compounded of wheels, pullics, levers, cords, and weights, ascending directly or obliquely, and other mechan ical powers ; as also the force of the tendons to move the bones of animals. COROLLARY III. The (/uaittity of motion, which is collected by taking the sum of the mo tions directed towards the same parts, and the difference of those that are directed to contrary parts, suffers no change from the action oj bodies among themselves. For action and its opposite re-action are equal, by Law III, and there fore, by Law II, they produce in the motions equal changes towards oppo site parts. Therefore if the motions are directed towards the same parts. whatever is added to the motion of the preceding body will be subducted from the motion of that which follows ; so that the sum will be the same as before. If the bodies meet, with contrary motions, there will be an equal deduction from the motions of both ; and therefore the difference of the motions directed towards opposite parts will remain the same. Thus if a spherical body A with two parts of velocity is triple of a spherical body B which follows in the same right line with ten parts of velocity, the motion of A will be to that of B as 6 to 10. Suppose, then, their motions to be of 6 parts and of 10 parts, and the sum will be 16 parts. Therefore, upon the meeting of the bodies, if A acquire 3, 4, or 5 parts of motion, B will lose as many ; and therefore after reflexion A will proceed With 9, 10, or 11 parts, and B with 7, 6, or 5 parts; the sum remaining always of 16 parts as before. If the body A acquire 9, 10, 11, or 12 parts of motion, and therefore after meeting proceed with 15, 16, 17",

Anno 1719, in the month of July, Dr. Desaguliers made some experiments of this kind again, by forming hogs' bladders into spheri cal orbs ; which was done by means of a concave wooden sphere, which the bladders, being wetted well first, were put into. After that being blown full of air. they were obliged to fill up the spherical cavity that contained them ; and then, when dry, were taken out. These were let fall from the lantern on the top of the cupola of the same church, namely, from a height of 272 feet ; and at the same moment of time there was let fall a leaden globe, whose weight was about 2 pounds troy weight. And in the mean time some persons standing in the upper part of the church where the globes were let fall observed the whole times of falling ; and others stand ing on the ground observed the differences of the times between the fall of the leaden weight and the fall of the bladder. The times were measured by pendulums oscillating to half seconds. And one of those that stood upon the ground had a machine vibrating four times in one second ; and another had another machine accurately made with a pendulum vibrating four times in a second also. One of those also who stood at the top of the church had a like machine ; and these instruments were so contrived, that their motions could be stopped or renewed at pleasure. Now the leaden globe fell in about four seconds and i of time; and from the addition of this time to the difference of time above spoken of, was collected the \\Vhole time in",
