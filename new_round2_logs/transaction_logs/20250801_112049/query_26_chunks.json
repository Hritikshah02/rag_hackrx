And this is the greatest variation of the inclination, abstracting from the situation of the moon in its orbit: for if the nodes are in the syzygies, the inclination suffers no change from the various positions of the moon. But if the nodes are in the quadratures, the inclination is less when the moon is in the syzygies than when it is in the quadratures by a difference of 2' 43\", as we shewed in Cor. 4 of the preceding Prop. ; and the whole mean variation BD, diminished by 1' 21 i\", the half of this excess, becomes 15'",

But it is suf ficient to have cleared the way to this speculation in Prop. VIII and IX foregoing, and their Corollaries. For in those Propositions, instead of the uniform resistance made to an ascending body arising from its gravity, one may substitute the uniform resistance which arises from the tenacity of the medium, when the body moves by its vis insita alone ; and when the body ascends in a right line, add this uniform resistance to the force of gravity, and subduct it when the body descends in a right line. One might also go on to the motion of bodies which are resisted in part uni formly, in part in the ratio of the velocity, and in part in the duplicate ratio of the same velocity. And I have opened a way to this in Prop.

COR. 2. But the perturbation will be greatest of all, if we suppose the uccelerative attractions of the parts of the system towards the greatest body of all are not to each other reciprocally as the squares of the distances from that great body ; especially if the inequality of this proportion be greater than the inequality of the proportion of the distances from the great body. For if the accelerative force, acting in parallel directions and equally, causes no perturbation in the motions of the parts of the system, it must of course, when it acts unequally, cause a perturbation some where, which will be greater or less as the inequality is greater or less. The excess of the greater impulses acting upon some bodies, and not acting upon others, must necessarily change their situation among themselves. And this perturbation, added to the perturbation arising from the inequality and inclination of the lines, makes the whole perturbation greater. COR. '*. Hence if the parts of this system move in ellipses or circles without any remarkable perturbation, it is manifest that, if they are at all impelled by accelerative forces tending to any other bodies, the impulse is very weak, or else is impressed very near equally and in parallel directions upon all of them.

XXXII and XXXIII) in the duplicate ratio of the velocity, in order to preserve the re sistance in the same duplicate ratio. But because this is not done, the globes that move swiftly are not so much pressed at their hinder parts as the others; and by the defect of this pressure it comes to pass that their resistance is a little greater than in a duplicate ratio of their velocity.

The conduct of Leibnitz in this affair is quite irreconcilable with the stature and strength of the man ; giant-like, and doing nobly, in many ways, a giant's work, yet cringing himself into the dimensions and performances of a common calumniator. Opening in 1699, the discussion in question continued till the close of Leibnitz's life, in 1716. We give the summary of the case as contained in the Report of the Committee of the Royal Society, the deliberately weighed opinion of which has been adopted as an authoritative decision in all countries. \" We have consulted the letters and letter books in the custody of the Royal Society, and those found among the papers of Mr. John Collins, dated between the years 1669 and 1677, inclusive ; and showed them to such as knew and avouched the hands of Mr. Barrow, Mr. Collins, Mr. Oldenburg, and Mr. Leibnitz ; and compared those of Mr. Gregory with one another, and with copies of some of them taken in the hand of Mr. Collins ; and have extracted from them what relates to the matter referred to us : all which extracts, herewith delivered to you, we believe to be genuine and authentic.

Jf all the parts of a spherical fluid, homogeneous at equal distances from the centre, lying on. a spherical concentric bottom, gravitate towards the centre of the whole, the bottom will sustain the weight of a cylin der, whose base is equal to the superficies of the bottom, and whose al titude is the same with that of the incumbent fluid.

Therefore the upper superficies AE is pressed by the single force of its own grav ity, by which all the parts of the upper orb, and the second superficies BFK, will (by Prop. XIX), according to its measure, be equally pressed. The second superficies BFK is pressed likewise by the force of its own gravity, which, added to the former force, makes the pressure double. The third superficies CGL is, according to its measure, acted on by this pressure and the force of its own gravity besides, which makes its pressure triple. And in like manner the fourth superfi cies receives a quadruple pressure, the fifth superficies a quintuple, and so on. Therefore the pressure acting on every superficies is not as the solid quantity of the incumbent fluid, but as the number of the orbs reaching to the upper surface of the fluid ; and is equal to the gravity of the lowest orb multiplied by the number of orbs : that is, to the gravity of a solid whose ultimate ratio to the cylinder above-mentioned (when the number of the orbs is increased and their thickness diminished, ad infiititum, so that the action of gravity from the lowest superficies to the uppermost may be- some continued) is the",
