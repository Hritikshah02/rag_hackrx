There is one Mr. Newton (whom I have very oft seen), Fellow of Trinity College, that is mighty famous for his learning, being a most excellent mathematician, philosopher, divine, &c. He has been Fellow of the Royal Society these many years ; and among other very learned books and tracts, he:s written one upon the mathe matical principles of philosophy, which has given him a mighty name, he having received, especially from Scotland, abundance of congratulatory letters for the same ; but of all the books he ever wrote, there was one of colours and light, established upon thou sands of experiments which he had been twenty years of making, and which had cost him many hundreds of pounds. This book which he vaiued so much, and which was so much talked of, had the ill luck to perish, and be utterly lost just when the learned author was almost at pitting a conclusion at the same, after this manner : In a winter's morning, leaving it among his other papers on his study table while he went to chapel, the candle, which he had unfortunately left burning there, too, catched hold by some means of other papers, and they fired the aforesaid book, and ut terly consumed it and several other valuable writings ; arid which is most wonderful did no further mischief. But when Mr. New ton came from chapel, and had seen what was done, every one thought he would have run mad, he was so troubled thereat that he was not himself for a month after. A long account of this his system of colours you may find in the Transactions of the Royal Society, which he had sent up to them long before this sad mis chance happened unto him.\" LIFE OF SIR ISAAC NEWTON. 43 It will be borne in mind that all of Newton's theological wri tings, with the exception of the Letters to Dr. Bentley, were composed before this event which, we must conclude, from Pryme's words, produced a serious impression upon our author for about a month. But M. Biot, in his Life of Newton, relying on a memorandum contained in a small manuscript Journal of Huygens, declares this occurrence to have caused a deran-gement of New ton's intellect. M. Blot's opinions and deductions, however, as well as those of La Place, upon this subject, were based upon erroneous data, and",

That the velocity and descent of a body falling in a fluid might more easily be known, I have composed the following table ; the first column of which denotes the times of descent ; the second shews the velocities ac quired in falling, the greatest velocity being 100000000: the third exhib its the spaces described by falling in those times, 2F being the space which the body describes in the time G with the greatest velocity ; and the fourth gives the spaces described with the greatest velocity in the same times. 2P The numbers in the fourth column are -pn and by subducting the number 1,3962944 — 4,60517021,, are found the numbers in the third column ; and these numbers must be multiplied by the space F to obtain the spaces described in falling.

VII. | OF NATURAL PHILOSOPHY. 347 \\ SCHOLIUM* In order to investigate the resistances of lluids from experiments, I pro cured a square wooden vessel, whose length and breadth on the inside was 9 inches English measure, and its depth 9 feet \\ ; this I filled with rain water: and having provided globes made up of wax, and lead included therein, I noted the times of the descents of these globes, the height through which they descended being 112 inches. A solid cubic foot of English measure contains 76 pounds troy weight of rain water ; and a solid inch contains if ounces troy weight, or 253 ' grains: and a globe of water of one inch in diameter contains 132,645 grains in air, or 132,8 grains in vacn.o ; and any other globe will be as the excess of its weight in vacuo above its weight in water. EXPER. 1. A globe whose weight was 156^ grains in air, and 77 grains in water, described the whole height of 1 12 inches in 4 seconds. And, upon repeating the experiment, the globe spent again the very same time of 4 seconds in falling. The weight of this globe in vacuo is 156^1 grains; and the excess of this weight above the weight of the globe in water is 79^ f grains. Hence the diameter of the globe appears to be 0,84224 parts of an inch. Then it will be, as that excess to the weight of the globe in vacuo, so is the density of the water to the density of the",

The conduct of Leibnitz in this affair is quite irreconcilable with the stature and strength of the man ; giant-like, and doing nobly, in many ways, a giant's work, yet cringing himself into the dimensions and performances of a common calumniator. Opening in 1699, the discussion in question continued till the close of Leibnitz's life, in 1716. We give the summary of the case as contained in the Report of the Committee of the Royal Society, the deliberately weighed opinion of which has been adopted as an authoritative decision in all countries. \" We have consulted the letters and letter books in the custody of the Royal Society, and those found among the papers of Mr. John Collins, dated between the years 1669 and 1677, inclusive ; and showed them to such as knew and avouched the hands of Mr. Barrow, Mr. Collins, Mr. Oldenburg, and Mr. Leibnitz ; and compared those of Mr. Gregory with one another, and with copies of some of them taken in the hand of Mr. Collins ; and have extracted from them what relates to the matter referred to us : all which extracts, herewith delivered to you, we believe to be genuine and authentic. And by these letters and papers wf find: — LIFE OF SIR ISAAC NEWTON. 49 \" I. Mr. Leibnitz was in London in the beginning of the year 1673 ; and went thence in or about March, to Paris, where he kept a correspondence with Mr. Collins, by means of Mr. Olden burg, till about September, 1676, and then returned, by London and Amsterdam, to Hanover: and that Mr. Collins was very free in communicating to able mathematicians what he had received from Mr, Newton and Mr. Gregory. \" II. That when Mr. Leibnitz was the first time in London, he contended for the invention of another differential method, properly so called ; and, notwithstanding he was shown by Dr. Pell that it was Newton?s method, persisted in maintaining it to be his own invention, by reason that he had found it by himself without knowing what Newton had done before, and had much improved",
