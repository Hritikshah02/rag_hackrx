Anno 1719, in the month of July, Dr. Desaguliers made some experiments of this kind again, by forming hogs' bladders into spheri cal orbs ; which was done by means of a concave wooden sphere, which the bladders, being wetted well first, were put into. After that being blown full of air. they were obliged to fill up the spherical cavity that contained them ; and then, when dry, were taken out. These were let fall from the lantern on the top of the cupola of the same church, namely, from a height of 272 feet ; and at the same moment of time there was let fall a leaden globe, whose weight was about 2 pounds troy weight. And in the mean time some persons standing in the upper part of the church where the globes were let fall observed the whole times of falling ; and others stand ing on the ground observed the differences of the times between the fall of the leaden weight and the fall of the bladder. The times were measured by pendulums oscillating to half seconds. And one of those that stood upon the ground had a machine vibrating four times in one second ; and another had another machine accurately made with a pendulum vibrating four times in a second also. One of those also who stood at the top of the church had a like machine ; and these instruments were so contrived, that their motions could be stopped or renewed at pleasure. Now the leaden globe fell in about four seconds and i of time; and from the addition of this time to the difference of time above spoken of, was collected the \\Vhole time in",

Therefore if hereafter I should happen to consider quantities as made up of particles, or should use little curve lines for right ones, I would not be un- (lerstood to mean indivisibles, but evanescent divisible quantities : not the sums and ratios of determinate parts, but always the limits of sums and ratios ; and that the force of such demonstrations always depends on the method laid down in the foregoing Lemmas. Perhaps it may be objected, that there is no ultimate proportion, of evanescent quantities ; because the proportion, before the quantities have vanished, is not the ultimate, and when they are vanished, is none. But by the same argument, it may be alledged, that a body arriving at a cer tain place, and there stopping has no ultimate velocity : because the velo city, before the body comes to the place, is not its ultimate velocity ; when it has arrived, is none i ut the answer is easy; for by the ultimate ve locity is meant that with which the body is moved, neither before it arrives at its last place and the motion ceases, nor after, but at the very instant it arrives ; that is, that velocity with which the body arrives at its last place, and with which the motion ceases.

This is the ultimate velocity. And there is the like limit in all quantities and pro portions that begin and cease to be. And since such limits are certain and definite, to determine the same is a problem strictly geometrical. But whatever is geometrical we may be allowed to use in determining and de monstrating any other thing that is likewise geometrical. It may also be objected, that if the ultimate ratios of evanescent quan tities are given, their ultimate magnitudes will be also given : and so all quantities will consist of indiv",

But here I speak of ovals that are not touched by conjugate figures running out in infinitvm. COR. Hence the area of an ellipsis, described by a radius drawn from the focus to the moving body, is not to be found from the time given by a finite equation ; and therefore cannot be determined by the description ol curves geometrically rational. Those curves I call geometrically rational, all the points whereof may be determined by lengths that are definable by equations ; that is, by the complicated ratios of lengths. Other curves (such as spirals, quadratrixes, and cycloids) I call geometrically irrational. For the lengths which are or are not as number to number (according to the tenth Book of Elements) are arithmetically rational or irrational. And therefore I cut off an area of an ellipsis proportional to the time in which it is described by a curve geometrically irrational, in the following manner. PROPOSITION XXXI. PROBLEM XXIII. To find the place of a body moving in a given elliptic trajectory at any assigned time. Suppose A to be the principal vertex, S the focus, and O the centre of the ellipsis A PB ; and let P be the place of the body to be found. Produce OA to G so as OG may be to OA as OA to OS. Erect the perpendicular GH; and about the centre O, with the interval OG, de scribe the circle* GEF ; and on the ruler GH, as a base, suppose the wheel GEF to move forwards, revolving about its axis, and in the mean time by its point A describing the cycloid ALL Which done, take GK to the perimeter GEFG of the wheel, in the ratio of the time in which the body proceeding from A described the arc AP, to the time of a whole revolution in the ellipsis. Erect the perpendicular KL meeting the cycloid in L ; then LP drawn parallel to KG will meet the ellipsis in P, the required place of the body. For about",

As a blind man has no idea of colours, so have we no idea of the manner by which the all-wise God perceives and understands all things. He is utterly void of all body, and bodily figure, and can therefore neither be seen, nor heard, nor touched ; nor ought he to be worshipped under the representation of any corporeal thing. We have ideas of his attributes, but what the real substance of anything is we know not. In bodies we see only their figures and colours, we hear only the sounds, we touch only their outward surfaces, we smell only the smells, and taste only the savours ; but their inward substances are not to be known, either by our senses, or by any reflex act of our minds : much less, then, have we any idea of the substance of God. We know him only by his most wise and excellent contrivances of things, and final causes ; we admire him for his perfections ; but we rev erence and adore him on account of his dominion ; for we adore him as his servants ; and a god without dominion, providence, and final causes, is nothing else but Fate and Nature. Blind meta physical necessity, which is certainly the same always and every where, could produce no variety of things. All that diversity of natural things which we find suited to different times and places could arise from nothing but the ideas and will of a Being neces sarily existing.\" Thus, the diligent student of science, the earnest seeker of truth, led, as through the courts of a sacred Temple, wherein, at each step, new wonders meet the eye, till, as a crowning grace, they stand before a Holy of Holies, and learn that all science and all truth are one which hath its beginning and its end in the knowledge of Him whose glory the heavens declare, and whose handiwork the firmament showeth forth. The introduction of the pure and lofty doctrines of the PRIN- CIPIA was perseveringly resisted. Descartes, with his system of vortices, had sown plausibly to the imagination, and error had struck down deeply, and shot up luxuriantly, not only in the popular, but in the scientific mind.

Therefore the use of this Corollary spreads far and wide, and by that diffusive extent the truth thereof is farther con firmed. For on what has been said depends the whole doctrine of mechan ics variously demonstrated by different authors. For from hence are easily deduced the forces of machines, which are compounded of wheels, pullics, levers, cords, and weights, ascending directly or obliquely, and other mechan ical powers ; as also the force of the tendons to move the bones of animals. COROLLARY III. The (/uaittity of motion, which is collected by taking the sum of the mo tions directed towards the same parts, and the difference of those that are directed to contrary parts, suffers no change from the action oj bodies among themselves. For action and its opposite re-action are equal, by Law III, and there fore, by Law II, they produce in the motions equal changes towards oppo site parts. Therefore if the motions are directed towards the same parts. whatever is added to the motion of the preceding body will be subducted from the motion of that which follows ; so that the sum will be the same as before. If the bodies meet, with contrary motions, there will be an equal deduction from the motions of both ; and therefore the difference of the motions directed towards opposite parts will remain the same. Thus if a spherical body A with two parts of velocity is triple of a spherical body B which follows in the same right line with ten parts of velocity, the motion of A will be to that of B as 6 to 10. Suppose, then, their motions to be of 6 parts and of 10 parts, and the sum will be 16 parts. Therefore, upon the meeting of the bodies, if A acquire 3, 4, or 5 parts of motion, B will lose as many ; and therefore after reflexion A will proceed With 9, 10, or 11 parts, and B with 7, 6, or 5 parts; the sum remaining always of 16 parts as before. If the body A acquire 9, 10, 11, or 12 parts of motion, and therefore after meeting proceed with 15, 16, 17",
