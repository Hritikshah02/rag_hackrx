Those, he would often remark, who gave away nothing till they died, never gave at all. His wealth had become considerable by a prudent economy ; but he regarded money in no other light than as one of the means wherewith he had been intrusted to do good, and he faithfully employed it accordingly. He experienced, in spite of all his precautionary measures, a return of his complaint in the month of August, of the same year, 1 724, when he passed a stone the size of pea ; it came from him in two pieces, the one at the distance of two day.s from the other. Tolerable good health then followed for some months. In Janu ary, 1725, however, he was taken with a violent cough and inflam mation of the lungs. In consequence of this attack, he was pre vailed upon to remove to Kensington, where his health greatly improved. In February following, he was attacked in both feet with the gout, of the approach of which he had received, a few years before, a slight warning, and the presence of which now produced a very beneficial change in his general health. Mr. Conduit, his nephew, has recorded a curious conversation which took place, at or near this time, between himself and Sir Isaac. \"I was, on Sunday night, the 7th March, 1724-5, at Kensing ton, with Sir Isaac Newton, in his lodgings, just after he was out of a fit of the gout, which he had had in both of his feet, for the first time, in the eighty-third year of his age. He was better after it, and his head clearer and memory stronger than I had known them for some time. He then repeated to me, by way of dis course, very distinctly, though rather in answer to my queries, than in one continued narration, what he had often hinted to me before, viz. : that it was his conjecture (he would affirm nothing) that there was a sort of revolution in the heavenly bodies ; that the vapours and light, emitted by the sun, which had their sedi ment, as water and other matter, had gathered themselves, by degrees, into a body, and attracted more matter from the planets, and at last made a secondary planet (viz.",

Anno 1719, in the month of July, Dr. Desaguliers made some experiments of this kind again, by forming hogs' bladders into spheri cal orbs ; which was done by means of a concave wooden sphere, which the bladders, being wetted well first, were put into. After that being blown full of air. they were obliged to fill up the spherical cavity that contained them ; and then, when dry, were taken out. These were let fall from the lantern on the top of the cupola of the same church, namely, from a height of 272 feet ; and at the same moment of time there was let fall a leaden globe, whose weight was about 2 pounds troy weight. And in the mean time some persons standing in the upper part of the church where the globes were let fall observed the whole times of falling ; and others stand ing on the ground observed the differences of the times between the fall of the leaden weight and the fall of the bladder. The times were measured by pendulums oscillating to half seconds. And one of those that stood upon the ground had a machine vibrating four times in one second ; and another had another machine accurately made with a pendulum vibrating four times in a second also. One of those also who stood at the top of the church had a like machine ; and these instruments were so contrived, that their motions could be stopped or renewed at pleasure. Now the leaden globe fell in about four seconds and i of time; and from the addition of this time to the difference of time above spoken of, was collected the \\Vhole time in",

V11I.J OF NATURAL PHILOSOPHY. 36£ receives a new motion either from the impulse of the tremulous body, or of the pulses propagated from that body. As soon, therefore, as the pulses cease to be propagated from the tremulous body, it will return to a state of rest, and move no more. PROPOSITION XLVIII. THEOREM XXXVIII. The velocities of pulses propagated in an elastic fluid are in a ratin compounded of the subduplicate, ratio of the elastic force directly, and the subduplicate ratio of the density inversely ; supposing the elastic Jorce of the fluid to be proportional to its condensation CASE I. If the mediums be homogeneous, and the distances of the pulses in those mediums be equal amongst themselves, but the motion in one me dium is more intense than in the other, the contractions and dilatations of the correspondent parts will be as those motions ; not that this proportion is perfectly accurate. However, if the contractions and dilatations are not exceedingly intense, the error will not be sensible ; and therefore this pro portion may be considered as physically exact. Now the motive elastic forces are as the contractions and dilatations ; and the velocities generated in the same time in equal parts are as the forces. Therefore equal and corresponding parts of corresponding pulses will go and return together, through spaces proportional to their contractions and dilatations, with ve locities that are as those spaces ; and therefore the pulses, which in the time of one going and returning advance forward a space dq'aal to their breadth, and are always succeeding into the places of the pulses that im mediately go before them, will, by reason of the equality of the distances, go forward in both mediums with equal velocity. CASE 2. If the distances of the pulses or their lengths are greater in one medium than in another, let us suppose that the correspondent parts de scribe spaces, in going and returning, each time proportional to the breadths of the pulses ; then will their contractions and dilatations be equal : and therefore if the mediums are homogeneous, the motive elastic forces, which agitate them with",

JNow let the time be expounded by the area RDGT and (by Laws, Cor. 2), distinguish the motion of the body into two others, one of ascent, the other lateral. And since the resistance is as the motion, let that also be distinguished into two parts proportional and contrary to the parts of the motion : and therefore the length described by the lateral motion will be (by Prop. II, Book II) as the line DR, and the height (by Prop. Ill, Book II) as the area DR X AB — RDGT, that is, as the line Rr. But in the very beginning of the motion the area RDGT is equal to the rectangle DR X AQ, and therefore that line Rr (or DRx AB — that is, as CP to DC ; and therefore as the motion upwards to the motion lengthwise at the beginning. Since, therefore, Rr is always as the height, and DR always as the length, and Rr is to DR at the beginning as the height to the length, it follows, that Rr is always to DR as the height to the length ; and therefore that the body will move in the line DraF. which is the locus of the point r.

COR. 2. Whence if innumerable lines CR, or, which is the same, innu merable lines ZX, be taken in a geometrical progression, there will be as many lines Xr in an arithmetical progression.

    "text": "and so on in infinitum. The parts so going, and in their going condensed, are pulses, by reason of the progressive motion with which they strike obstacles in their way; and therefore the successive pulses produced by a tremulous body will be propagated in rectilinear directions ; and that at nearly equal distances from each other, because of the equal intervals of time in which the body, by its several tremors produces the several pulses. And though the parts of the tremulous body go and return .n some certain and deter minate direction, yet the pulses propagated from thence through the medium will dilate themselves towards the sides, by the foregoing Proposition : anc7 360 THE MATHEMATICAL PRINCIPLES [BoOK 11 will be propagated on all sides from that tremulous body, as from a com mon centre, in superficies nearly spherical and concentrical. An example of this we have in waves excited by shaking a finger in water, which proceed not only forward and backward agreeably to the motion of the finger, but spread themselves in the manner of concentrical circles all round the finger, and are propagated on every side. For the gravity of the water supplies the place of elastic force. Case 2. If the medium be not elastic, then, because its parts cannot be condensed by the pressure arising from the vibrating parts of the tremulous body, the motion will be propagated in an instant towards the parts where the medium yields most easily, that is; to the parts which the tremulous body would otherwise leave vacuous behind it. The case is the same with that of a body projected in any medium whatever. A medium yielding to projectiles does not recede in infinitum, but with a circular motion comes round to the spaces which the body leaves behind it. Therefore as often as a tremulous body tends to any part, the medium yielding to it comes round in a circle to the parts which the body leaves ; and as often as the body returns to the first place, the medium will be driven from the place it came round to, and return to its original place. And though the tremulous bod} be not firm and hard, but every way flexible, yet if it continue of a given magnitude, since it cannot impel the medium by its treniors any where without yielding to it somewhere else, the medium receding from the parts of the body where it is pressed will always come round in a circle to the parts that yield to it.",
