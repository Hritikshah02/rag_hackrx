Anno 1719, in the month of July, Dr. Desaguliers made some experiments of this kind again, by forming hogs' bladders into spheri cal orbs ; which was done by means of a concave wooden sphere, which the bladders, being wetted well first, were put into. After that being blown full of air. they were obliged to fill up the spherical cavity that contained them ; and then, when dry, were taken out. These were let fall from the lantern on the top of the cupola of the same church, namely, from a height of 272 feet ; and at the same moment of time there was let fall a leaden globe, whose weight was about 2 pounds troy weight. And in the mean time some persons standing in the upper part of the church where the globes were let fall observed the whole times of falling ; and others stand ing on the ground observed the differences of the times between the fall of the leaden weight and the fall of the bladder. The times were measured by pendulums oscillating to half seconds. And one of those that stood upon the ground had a machine vibrating four times in one second ; and another had another machine accurately made with a pendulum vibrating four times in a second also. One of those also who stood at the top of the church had a like machine ; and these instruments were so contrived, that their motions could be stopped or renewed at pleasure. Now the leaden globe fell in about four seconds and i of time; and from the addition of this time to the difference of time above spoken of, was collected the \\Vhole time in",

Therefore if hereafter I should happen to consider quantities as made up of particles, or should use little curve lines for right ones, I would not be un- (lerstood to mean indivisibles, but evanescent divisible quantities : not the sums and ratios of determinate parts, but always the limits of sums and ratios ; and that the force of such demonstrations always depends on the method laid down in the foregoing Lemmas. Perhaps it may be objected, that there is no ultimate proportion, of evanescent quantities ; because the proportion, before the quantities have vanished, is not the ultimate, and when they are vanished, is none. But by the same argument, it may be alledged, that a body arriving at a cer tain place, and there stopping has no ultimate velocity : because the velo city, before the body comes to the place, is not its ultimate velocity ; when it has arrived, is none i ut the answer is easy; for by the ultimate ve locity is meant that with which the body is moved, neither before it arrives at its last place and the motion ceases, nor after, but at the very instant it arrives ; that is, that velocity with which the body arrives at its last place, and with which the motion ceases.

And the first or last sum is that with which they begin and cease to be (or to be augmented or diminished). There is a limit which the ve locity at the end of the motion may attain, but not exceed. This is the ultimate velocity. And there is the like limit in all quantities and pro portions that begin and cease to be. And since such limits are certain and definite, to determine the same is a problem strictly geometrical. But whatever is geometrical we may be allowed to use in determining and de monstrating any other thing that is likewise geometrical. It may also be objected, that if the ultimate ratios of evanescent quan tities are given, their ultimate magnitudes will be also given : and so all quantities will consist of indiv",

The weight of water which the circle PQ; when very small, sus tains, seems to be less than the weight of two thirds of a cylinder of water whose base is that little circle, and its altitude HG. For, things standing as above supposed, imagine the half of a spheroid described whose base id that little circle, and its semi-axis or altitude HG. This figure will be equal to two thirds of that cylinder, and will comprehend within it the column of congealed water PHQ, the weight of which is sustained by that little circle. For though the motion of the water tends directly down wards, the external superficies of that column must yet meet the base PQ in an angle somewhat acute, because the water in its fall is perpetually ac celerated, and by reason of that acceleration become narrower. Therefore, oince that angle is less than a right one, this column in the lower parts thereof will lie within the hemi-spheroid. In the upper parts also it will be acute or pointed; because to make it otherwise, the horizontal motion of the water must be at the vertex infinitely more swift than its motion to wards the horizon. And the less this circle PQ is, the more acute will 22 338 THE MATHEMATICAL PRINCIPLES [BOOK II the vertex of this column be ; and the circle being diminished in infinitn/n the angle PHQ will be diminished in infinitum, and therefore the co lumn will lie within the hemi-spheroid.

Now the little circle sustains a force of water equal to the weight of this column, the weight of the ambient water being employed in causing",

It may also happen that the greatest tide may be the fourth or fifth after the syzygies, or fall out yet later, because the motions of the sea are retarded in passing through shallow places towards the shores: for so the tide arrives at the western coast of Ireland at the third lunar hour, and an hour or two after at the ports in the southern coast of the same island ; as also at the islands Cftssiterides, commonly Sorliti^s ; then successively at Palrnonth.
