But if we observed the cord, and found that its tension was that very tension which the motions of the globes required, we might conclude the motion to be in the globes, and the bodies to be at rest ; and then, lastly, from the trans lation of the globes among the bodies, we should find the determination oi their motions. But how we are to collect the true motions from their causes, effects, and apparent differences ; and, vice versa, how from the mo tions, either true or apparent, we may come to the knowledge of theii causes and effects, shall be explained more at large in the following tra<;t For to this end it was that I composed it. OF NATURAL PHILOSOPHY. AXIOMS, OR LAWS OF MOTION. LAW I. Hvery body perseveres in its state of rest, or of uniform motion in a ri^ht line, unless it is compelled to change that state by forces impressed thereon. PROJECTILES persevere in their motions, so far as they are not retarded by the resistance of the air, or impelled downwards by the force of gravity A top, whose parts by their cohesion are perpetually drawn aside from rectilinear motions, does not cease its rotation, otherwise than as it is re tarded by the air. The greater bodies of the planets and comets, meeting with less resistance in more free spaces, preserve then jDotions both pro gressive and circular for a much longer time. LAW II. The alteration of motion is ever proportional to the motive force imp reus ed ; and is made in the direction of the right line in. which that force is impressed. If any force generates a motion, a double force will generate double the motion, a triple force triple the motion, whether that force be impressed altogether and at once, or gradually and successively. And this motion (being always directed the same way with the generating force), if the body moved before, is added to or subducted from the former motion, according as they directly conspire with or are directly contrary to each other ; or obliquely joined, when they are oblique, so as to produce a new motion compounded from the determination of both. LAW III. To every action there is always opposed an equal reaction : or the mu tual actions of two bodies",

Our design not respecting arts, but philosophy, and our subject not manual but natural powers, we consider chiefly those things which relate to gravity, levity, elastic force, the resist ance of fluids, and the like forces, whether attractive or impulsive ; and therefore we offer this work as the mathematical principles :f philosophy ; for all the difficulty of philosophy seems to consist in this — from the phenom ena of motions to investigate the forces of nature, and then from these forces to demonstrate the other phenomena ; and to this end the general propositions in the first and second book are directed. In the third book we give an example of this in the explication of the System of the World : for by the propositions mathematically demonstrated in the former books, we in the third derive from the celestial phenomena the forces of gravity with which bodies tend to the sun and the several planets. Then from these forces, by other propositions which are also mathematical, we deduce the mo tions of the planets, the comets, the moon, and the sea. I wish we could do- rive the rest of the phenomena of nature by the same kind of reasoning from mechanical principles; for I am induced by many reasons to suspect that they may all depend upon certain forces by which the particles of bodies. by some causes hitherto unknown, are either mutually impelled towards each other, and cohere in regular figures, or are repelled and recede from each other; which forces being unknown, philosophers have hitherto at tempted the search of nature in vain ; but I hope the principles here laid down will afford some light either to this or some truer method of philosophy. In the publication of this work the most acute and universally learned Mr. Edmund H alley not only assisted me with his pains in correcting the press and taking care of the schemes, but it was to his solicitations that its becoming public is owing ; for when he had obtained of me my demonstra tions of the figure of the celestial orbits, he continually pressed me to com municate the same to the Royal Societ //, who afterwards, by their kind en couragement and entreaties, engaged me to think of publishing them.

He demon strated, too, that this force, or attracting, gravitating power re sided in every, the least particle ; but that, in spherical masses, it operated as if confined to their centres ; so that, one sphere or body will act upon another sphere or body, with a force directly proportional to the quantity of matter, and inversely as the square of the distance between their centres; and that their velocities of mutual approach will be in the inverse ratio of their quantities o*' matter. Thus he grandly outlined the Universal Law. Verify ing its truth by the motions of terrestrial bodies, then by those of the moon and other secondary orbs, he finally embraced, in one mighty generalization, the entire Solar System — all the move ments of all its bodies — planets, satellites and comets — explain ing and harmonizing the many diverse and theretofore inexplica ble phenomena. Guided by the genius of Newton, we see sphere bound to sphere, body to body, particle to particle, atom to mass, the min utest part to the stupendous whole — each to each, each to all, and all to each — in the mysterious bonds of a ceaseless, recipro cal influence.

In forming this conclusion, he supposed the planets to move in perfect circles, concentric to the sun. Now was this the law of the moon's motion ? Was such a force, em anating from the earth and directed to the moon, sufficient, when diminished as the square of the distance, to retain her in her orbit ? To ascertain this master-fact, he compared the space through which heavy bodies fall, in a second of time, at a given distance from the centre of the earth, namely, at its surface, with the space through which the moon falls, as it were, to the earth, in the same time, while revolving in a circular orbit. He was absent from books ; and, therefore, adopted, in computing the earth's diameter, the common estimate of sixty miles to a degree of latitude as then in use among geographers and navigators. The result of his calculations did not, ot course, answer his ex pectations ; hence, he concluded that some other cause, beyond the reach of observation — analogous, perhaps, to the vortices of Des cartes — joined its action to that of the power of gravity upon the rnooil. Though by no means satisfied, he yet abandoned awhile further inquiry, and remained totally silent upon the subject. These rapid marches in the career of discovery, combined with the youth of Newton, seem to evince a penetration the most lively, and an invention the most exuberant. But in him there was a conjunction of influences as extraordinary as fortunate. Study, unbroken, persevering and profound carried on its inform ing and disciplining work upon a genius, natively the greatest, and rendered freest in its movements, and clearest in its vision, through the untrammelling and enlig} tenirig power of religion.

Picard, a French Astronomer, in 1679. Newton took a memorandum oi the result ; and afterward, at the earliest opportunity, computed from it the diameter of the earth : furnished with these new data, he resumed his calculation of 1666. As he proceeded therein, he saw that his early expectations were now likely to be realized ; the thick rushing, stupendous results overpowered him ; he be came unable to carry on the process of calculation, and intrusted its completion to one of his friends. The discoverer had, indeed, grasped the master-fact. The law of falling bodies at the earth's surface was at length identified with that which guided the moon in her orbit. And so his GREAT THOUGHT, that had for sixteen years loomed up in dim, gigantic outline, amid the first dawn of a plausible hypothesis, now stood forth, radiant and not less grand, in the mid-day light of demonstrated truth. It were difficult, nay impossible to imagine, even, the influence of a result like this upon a mind like Newton's. It was as if the keystone had been fitted to the glorious arch by which his spirit should ascend to the outskirts of infinite space — spanning the immea surable — weighing the imponderable — computing the incalculable —mapping out the marchings of the planets, and the far-wander ings of the comefs, and catching, bring back to earth some clearer notes of that higher melody which, as a sounding voice, bears perpetual witness to the design and omnipotence of a creating Deity. Newton, extending the law thus obtained, composed a series of about twelve propositions on the motion of the primary planets LIFE OF SIR ISAAC NEWTON. 31 about the sun. These were sent to London, and communicated to the Royal Society about the end of 1683. At or near this pe riod, other philosophers, as Sir Christopher Wren, Dr. Halley, and Dr. Hooke, were engaged in investigating the same subject ; but with no definite or satisfactory results. Dr. Halley, having seen, it is presumed, our author's propositions, went in August, 1684, to Cambridge to consult with him upon the subject. Newton assured",
