The widow Newton was left with the simple means of a com fortable subsistence. The Woolsthorpe estate together with small one which she possessed at Sewstern, in Leicestershire, yield ed her an income of some eighty pounds ; and upon this limited sum, she had to rely chiefly for the support of herself, and the educa tion of her child. She continued his nurture for three years, when, marrying again, she confided the tender charge to the care of her own mother. Great genius is seldom marked by precocious development ; and young Isaac, sent, at the usual age, to two day schools at Skillington and Stoke, exhibited no unusual traits of character. In his twelfth year, he was placed at the public school at Gran- tham, and boarded at the house of Mr. Clark, an apothecary. But even in this excellent seminary, his mental acquisitions con tinued for a while unpromising enough : study apparentlv had no charms for him ; he was very inattentive, and ranked low in the school. One day, however, the boy immediately above our seem ingly dull student gave him a severe kick in the stomach ; Isaac, deeply affected, but with no outburst of passion, betook himself, with quiet, incessant toil, to his books ; he quickly passed above the offending classmate ; yet there he stopped not ; the strong spirit was, for once and forever, awakened, and, yielding to itb noble impulse, he speedily took up his position at the head of all. His peculiar character began now rapidly to unfold itself. Close application grew to be habitual.

FROM the thick darkness of the middle ages man's struggling spirit emerged as in new birth ; breaking out of the iron control of that period ; growing strong and confident in the tug and din of succeeding conflict and revolution, it bounded forwards and upwards with resistless vigour to the investigation of physical and moral truth ; ascending height after height ; sweeping afar over the earth, penetrating afar up into the heavens ; increasing in en deavour, enlarging in endowment ; every where boldly, earnestly out-stretching, till, in the AUTHOR of the PRINCIPIA, one arose, who, grasping the master-key of the universe and treading its celestial paths, opened up to the human intellect the stupendous realities of the material world, and, in the unrolling of its harmo nies, gave to the human heart a new song to the goodness, wis dom, and majesty of the all-creating, all-sustaining, all-perfect God. Sir Isaac Newton, in whom the rising intellect seemed to attain, as it were, to its culminating point, was born on the 25th of De cember, O. S. 1642 — Christmas day — at Woolsthorpe, in the parish of Colsterworth, in Lincolnshire. His father, John New ton, died at the age of thirty-six, and only a few months after his marriage to Harriet Ayscough, daughter of James Ayscough, oi Rutlandshire. Mrs. Newton, probably wrought upon by the early loss of her husband, gave premature birth to her only and posthumous child, of which, too, from its extreme diminutiveness, she appeared likely to be soon bereft. Happily, it was otherwise decreed ! The tiny infant, on whose little lips the breath of life 10 LIFE OF SIR ISAAC NEWTON. so doubtingly hovered, lived ; — lived to a vigorous maturity, to a hale old age ; — lived to become the boast of his country, the won der of his time, and the \"ornament of his srjecies.\" Beyond the grandfather, Robert Newton, the descent of Sir Isaac cannot with certainty be traced.

THE AUTHOR'S PREFACE SINCE the ancients (as we are told by Pappus), made great account oi the science of mechanics in the investigation of natural things : and the moderns, laying aside substantial forms and occult qualities, have endeav oured to subject the phenomena of nature to the laws of mathematics, I have in this treatise cultivated mathematics so far as it regards philosophy. The ancients considered mechanics in a twofold respect ; as rational, which proceeds accurately by demonstration ; and practical. To practical me chanics all the manual arts belong, from which mechanics took its name. Rut as artificers do not work with perfect accuracy, it comes to pass that mechanics is so distinguished from geometry, that what is perfectly accu rate is called geometrical , what is less",

His senses and faculties were then strong and vigorous ; but at six o'clock, the same evening, he became insen sible ; and in this state he continued during the whole of Sunday, and till Monday, the 20th, when he expired, between one and two o'clock in the morning, in the eighty-fifth year of his age. And these were the last days of Isaac Newton. Thus closed the career of one of earth's greatest and best men. His mission was fulfilled.

His body was placed in Westminster Abbey, with the state and ceremonial that usually attended the interment of the most distinguished. In 1731, his relatives, the inheritors of his personal estate, erected a monument to his memory in the most conspicu ous part of the Abbey, which had often been refused by the dean and chapter to the greatest of England's nobility. During the same year a medal was struck at the Tower in his honour ; arid, in 1755, a full-length statue of him, in white marble, admirably executed, by Roubiliac, at the expense of Dr. Robert Smith, was erected in the ante-chamber of Trinity College, Cambridge. There is a painting executed in the glass of one of the windows of the same college, made pursuant to the will of Dr. Smith, who left five hundred pounds for that purpose. Newton left a personal estate of about thirty-two thousand pounds. It was divided among his four nephews and four nieces of the half blood, the grand-children of his mother, by the Reve rend Mr. Smith.

Two or three years younger than himself, of great per sonal beauty, and unusual talent, her society afforded him the greatest pleasure ; and their youthful friendship, it is believed, gradually rose to a higher passion ; but inadequacy of fortune prevented their union. Miss Storey was afterwards twice mar ried ; Newton, never; his esteem for her continued unabated during life, accompanied by numerous acts of attention and kindness. In 1656, Newton's mother was again left a widowr, and took up her abode once more at Woolsthorpe. He was now fifteen years of age, and had made great progress in his studies ; but she, desirous of his help, and from motives of economy, recalled him from school. Business occupations, however, and the manage ment of the farm, proved utterly distasteful to him. When sent to Grantham Market on Saturdays, he would betake himself to his former lodgings in the apothecary's garret, where some of Mr. Clark's old books employed his thoughts till the aged and trust worthy servant had executed the family commissions and announced the necessity of return : or, at other times, our young philosopher would seat himself under a hedge, by the wayside, and continue his studies till the same faithful personage — proceeding alone to the town and completing the day's business — stopped as he re- LIFE OF SIR ISAAC NEWTON, 13 turned. The more immediate affairs of the farm received no better attention. In fact, his passion for study grew daily more absorbing, and his dislike for every other occupation more in tense. His mother, therefore, wisely resolved to give him all the advantages which an education could confer. He was sent back to Grantham school, where he remained for some months in busy preparation for his academical studies.

His researches into this science were prosecuted with unparallelled vigour and success. Regarding the propositions contained in Euclid as self-evident truths, he passed rapidly over this ancient system — a step which he afterward much regretted — and mastered, without further pre paratory study, the Analytical Geometry of Descartes. Wallis's Arithmetic of Infinites, Saunderson's Logic, and the Optics of Kepler, he also studied with great care ; writing upon them many comments ; and, in these notes on Wallis's work was un doubtedly the germ of his fluxionary calculus. His progress was so great that he found himself more profoundly versed than his tutor in many branches of learning. Yet his acquisitions were not gotten with the rapidity of intuition ; but they were thoroughly made and firmly secured. Quickness of apprehension, or Intel lectual nimbleness did not belong to him. He saw too far : his, insight was too deep. He dwelt fully, cautiously upon the least subject ; while to the consideration of the greatest, he brought a massive strength joined with a matchless clearness, that, regard less of the merely trivial or unimportant, bore with unerring sa gacity upon the prominences of the subject, and, grappling with its difficulties, rarely failed to surmount them. 14 LIFE OF SIR ISAAC NEWTON His early and fast friend, Dr. Barrow — in compass of inven tion only inferior to Newton — who had been elected Professor of Greek in the University, in 1660, was made Lucasian Profes sor of Mathematics in 1663, and soon afterward delivered his Optical Lectures : the manuscripts of these were revised by New ton, and several overs",

A ihird edition of the PRINCIPIA appeared in 1726, with many changes and additions. About four years were consumed in its preparation and publication, which were under the superintend- ance of Dr. Henry Pemberton, an accomplished mathematician, and the author of \"A VIEW OF SIR ISAAC NEWTON'S PHILO SOPHY.\" 1728. This gentleman enjoyed numerous opportunities of conversing with the aged and illustrious author. \" I found,\" says Pemberton, \" he had read fewer of the modern mathemati cians than one could have expected; but his own prodigious invention readily supplied him with what he might have an occa sion for in the pursuit of any subject he undertook. I have often LIFE OF SIR ISAAC NEWTON. 57 heard him censure the handling geometrical subjects ly algebraic calculations ; and his book of Algebra he called by the name of Universal Arithmetic, in opposition to the injudicious title of Geometry, which Descartes had given to the treatise, wherein he shows how the geometer may assist his invention by such kind of computations. He thought Huygens the most elegant of any mathematical writer of modern times, and the most just imitator of the ancients. Of their taste and form of demonstration, Sir Isaac always professed himself a great admirer. I have heard him even censure himself for not following them yet more closely than he did ; and speak with regret of his mistake at the begin ning of his mathematical studies, in applying himself to the works of Descartes and other algebraic writers, before he had considered the elements of Euclid with that attention which so excellent a writer deserves.\" \" Though his memory was much decayed,\" continues Dr. Pem- berton, \"he perfectly understood his own writings.\" And even this failure of memory, we would suggest, might have been more apparent than real, or, in medical terms, more the result of func tional weakness than organic decay. Newton seems never to have confided largely to his memory : and as this faculty mani fests the most susceptibility to cultivation ; so, in the neglect of due exercise, it more readily and plainly shows a diminution of its powers.
