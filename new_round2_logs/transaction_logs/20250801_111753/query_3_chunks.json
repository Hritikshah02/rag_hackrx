We also recommend that you wear eye protection, sturdy boots, gloves and other protective gear.Before riding your vehicleMake sure that you are physically fit, mentally focused and free of alcohol and drugs. Check that you and your pillion are both wearing an approved vehicle helmet and protective apparel. Instruct your pillion on holding onto the grab rail or your waist, leaning with you in turns, and keeping their feet on the footrest, even when the vehicle is stopped.IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION There is much that you can do to protect yourself when you ride. You will find many helpful recommendations through out this manual. Following are a few that we consider most important.Always wear a helmet Even if you have ridden other vehicles, practice riding in a safe area to become familiar with how this vehicle works and handles, and to become accustomed to the vehicle's size and weight.VEHICLE SAFETY Always pay due attention to other vehicles around you, and do not assume that other drivers see you. Be prepared to stop quickly or perform an evasive maneuver. Some drivers do not see vehicles because they are not looking for them. To make yourself more visible, wear bright reflective clothing, position yourself so that others can see you, signal before turning or changing lanes, and use horn which will help others to notice you. Do not drink and rideRide defensively Make yourself easily visible Ride within your limitsPushing the limits is another major cause of vehicle accidents. Never ride beyond your personal abilities or faster than conditions demand. Remember that fatigue and negligence can significantly reduce your ability to make good judgements and ride safely. Riding under the influence of alcohol or drugs is dangerous. Alcohol can reduce your ability to respond to changing conditions and reduce the reaction time. Do not drink and ride. Keep your vehicle in safe conditionFor safe riding, its important to inspect your vehicle before every ride and perform all recommended maintenance. Never exceed load limits, and use accessories that have been recommended by Hero MotoCorp for this vehicle. 8 Your helmet is your most important piece of riding gear because it offers the best protection against head injuries. A helmet should fit your head comfortably and securely. A bright coloured helmet can make you more noticeable in traffic, as can reflective strips. In addition to a helmet and eye protection, we also recommend: •Leather gloves to keep your hands warm and help prevent blisters, cuts, burns, and bruises.An open-face helmet offers some protection, but a full-face helmet offers more.",
