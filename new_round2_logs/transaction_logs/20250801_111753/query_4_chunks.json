It can set on fire any combustible material that come near it. Park your vehicle away from high grasses, dry leaves, or other flammable material. Follow these guidelines to protect your vehicle’s catalytic converter. • Always use unleaded petrol. Even a small amount of leaded petrol can contaminate the catalyst metals, making the catalytic converter ineffective. • Keep the engine in good running condition. A poorly running engine can cause the catalytic converter to overheat. • If your engine is misfiring, backfiring, stalling, or otherwise not running properly, stop riding and turn “OFF” the engine.Have your vehicle serviced as soon aspossible.

During warm weather, the petrol vapours which contain HC evaporates easily into the atmosphere from the fuel tank, if the fuel system is unsealed or open. The evaporative emission control system is used to prevent petrol vapours from escaping into the atmosphere from fuel tank. The canister (1) collects the fuel vapour from the fuel tank and then the fuel vapour is drawn into the engine for re-burning to avoid pollution caused by the fuel vapour diffused into the air.
