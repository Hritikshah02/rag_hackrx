The later philosophers pretend to account for it either by the action of certain vortices, as Kepler and Des Cartes ; or by some other principle of impulse or attraction, as Borelli, Honke, and others of our nation ; for, from the laws of motion, it is most certain that these effects must proceed from the action of some force or other. But our purpose is only to trace out the quantity and properties of this force from the phenomena (p. 218), and to apply what we discover in some simple cases as principles, by which, in a mathematical way, we may esti mate the effects thereof in more involved cases : for it would be endless and impossible to bring every particular to direct and immediate observation. We said, in a mathematical way, to avoid all questions about the na ture or quality of this force, which we would not be understood to deter mine by any hypothesis; and therefore call it by the general name of a centripetal force, as it is a force which is directed towards some centre ; and as it regards more particularly a body in that centre, we call it circum solar, circum-terrestrial, circum-jovial ; and in like manner in respect of other central bodies. That by means of centripetal forces the planets may be retained in cer tain orbits, we may easily understand, if we consider the motions of pro jectiles (p. 75, 76, 77) ; for a stone projected is by the pressure of its own weight forced out of the rectilinear path, which by the projection alone it should have pursued, and made to describe a curve line in the air ; and through that crooked way is at last brought down to the ground ; and the greater the velocity is with which it is projected, the farther it goes before it falls to the earth.

For if a body by means of its gravity re volves in a circle concentric to the earth, this gravity is the centripetal force of that body. But from the descent of heavy bodies, the time of one entire revolution, as well as the arc described in any given time, is given (by Cor. 9 of this Prop.). And by such propositions, Mr. Huygens, in his excellent book De Horologio Oscillatorio, has compared the force of gravity with the centrifugal forces of revolving bodies. The preceding Proposition may be likewise demonstrated after this manner. In any circle suppose a polygon to be inscribed of any number of sides. And if a body, moved with a given velocity along the sides of the polygon, is reflected from the circle at the several angular points, the force, with which at every reflection it strikes the circle, will be as its velocity : and therefore the sum of the forces, in a given time, will be as that ve locity and the number of reflections conjunctly ; that is (if the species of the polygon be given), as the length described in that given time, and in creased or diminished in the ratio of the same length to the radius of the circle ; that is, as the square of that length applied to the radius ; and therefore the polygon, by having its sides diminished in'inftnitum, coin cides with the circle, as the square of the arc described in a given time ap plied to the radius. This is the centrifugal force, with which the body impels the circle ; and to which the contrary force, wherewith the circle continually repels the body towards the centre, is equal. PROPOSITION V.

I, of this Book. Now if the lowest of these were very small, and were so near the earth as almost to touo the tops of the highest mountains, the centripetal force thereof, retaining it in its orb, would be very nearly equal to the weights of any terrestrial bodies that should be found upon the tops of those mountains, as may be known by the foregoing computation. Therefore if the same little moon should be deserted by its centrifugal force that carries it through its orb, and so be BOOK 111.] OF NATURAL PHILOSOPHY. 393 lisabled from going onward therein, it would descend to the earth ; and that with the same velocity as heavy bodies do actually fall with upo-n the tops of those very mountains ; because of the equality of the forces that oblige them both to descend. And if the force by which that lowest moon would descend were different from gravity, and if that moon were to gravi tate towards the earth, as we find terrestrial bodies do upon the tops of mountains, it would then descend with twice the velocity, as being impel led by both these forces conspiring together. Therefore since both these forces, that is, the gravity of heavy bodies, and the centripetal forces of the moons, respect the centre of the earth, and are similar and equal between themselves, they will (by Rule I and II) have one and the same cause. And therefore the force which retains the moon in its orbit is that very force which we commonly call gravity ; because otherwise this little moon at the top of a mountain must either be without gravity, or fall twice as swiftly as heavy bodies are wont to do.
