A ihird edition of the PRINCIPIA appeared in 1726, with many changes and additions. About four years were consumed in its preparation and publication, which were under the superintend- ance of Dr. Henry Pemberton, an accomplished mathematician, and the author of \"A VIEW OF SIR ISAAC NEWTON'S PHILO SOPHY.\" 1728. This gentleman enjoyed numerous opportunities of conversing with the aged and illustrious author. \" I found,\" says Pemberton, \" he had read fewer of the modern mathemati cians than one could have expected; but his own prodigious invention readily supplied him with what he might have an occa sion for in the pursuit of any subject he undertook. I have often LIFE OF SIR ISAAC NEWTON. 57 heard him censure the handling geometrical subjects ly algebraic calculations ; and his book of Algebra he called by the name of Universal Arithmetic, in opposition to the injudicious title of Geometry, which Descartes had given to the treatise, wherein he shows how the geometer may assist his invention by such kind of computations. He thought Huygens the most elegant of any mathematical writer of modern times, and the most just imitator of the ancients. Of their taste and form of demonstration, Sir Isaac always professed himself a great admirer. I have heard him even censure himself for not following them yet more closely than he did ; and speak with regret of his mistake at the begin ning of his mathematical studies, in applying himself to the works of Descartes and other algebraic writers, before he had considered the elements of Euclid with that attention which so excellent a writer deserves.\" \" Though his memory was much decayed,\" continues Dr. Pem- berton, \"he perfectly understood his own writings.\" And even this failure of memory, we would suggest, might have been more apparent than real, or, in medical terms, more the result of func tional weakness than organic decay. Newton seems never to have confided largely to his memory : and as this faculty mani fests the most susceptibility to cultivation ; so, in the neglect of due exercise, it more readily and plainly shows a diminution of its powers. Equanimity and temperance had, indeed, preserved Newton singular",

There were no \"resentments,\" how ever, as we conceive, in his \" design to suppress.\" He sought peace ; for he loved and valued it above all applause. But, in spite of his efforts for tranquillity's sake, his course of discovery was all along molested by ignorance or presumptuous rivalry. The publication of the great work now went rapidly forwards, The second book was sent to the Society, and presented on the 2d March ; the third, on the 6th April ; and the whole was com pleted and published in the month of May, 1686-7. In the sec ond Lemma of the second book, the fundamental principle of his fiuxionary calculus was, for the first time, given to the world ; but its algorithm or notation did not appear till published in the second volume nf Dr. Wallis's works, in 1693. And thus was ushered into existence The PRINCIPIA — a work to which pre-eminence above all the productions of the human intellect has been awarded — a work that must be esteemed of priceless worth so long as Science has a votary, or a single wor shipper be left to kneel at the altar of Truth. LIFE OF SIR ISAAC NEWTON. 33 The entire work bears the general title of THE MATHEMATICAL PRINCIPLES OF NATURAL PHILOSOPHY. It consists of three books: the first two, entitled, OF THE MOTION OF BODIES, are occupied with the laws and conditions of motions and forces, and are illus trated with many scholia treating of some of the most general and best established points in philosophy, such as the density and resistance of bodies, spaces void of matter, and the motion of sound and light. From these principles, there is deduced, in the third book, drawn up in as popular a style as possible and entitled, OF THE SYSTEM OF THE WORLD, the constitution of the system of i he world. In regard to this book, the author say^ — \" I had, indeed, composed the third Book in a popular method, that it might be read by many ; but afterwards, considering that such as had not suf- ficently entered into the principles could not easily discover the strength of the consequences, nor lay aside the prejudices to which they had been many years accustomed, therefore,",

Our author's early Treatise, entitled, ANALYSIS PER EQUATIONES NUMERO TERMINORUM INFINITAS, as well as a small Tract, Gearing the title of METHODUS DIFFERENTIALS, was published, witn nis consent, in 1711. The' former of these, and the Treatise De Quadratura Curvarum, translated into Englisn, witn a .arge com mentary, appeared in 1745. His work, entitled.

It is a notable fact, in Newton's history, that he never volun* tarily published any one of his purely mathematical writings The cause of this unwillingness in some, and, in other instances, of his indifference, or, at least, want of solicitude to put forth his works may be confidently sought for in his repugnance to every thing like contest or dispute. But, going deeper than this aver sion, we find, underlying his whole character and running parallel with all his discoveries, that extraordinary humility which always preserved him in a position so relatively just to the behests of time and eternity, that the infinite value of truth, and the utter worthlessness of fame, were alike constantly present to him. Judging of his course, however, in its more temporary aspect, as bearing upon his immediate quiet, it seemed the most unfortunate. For an early publication, especially in the case of his Method of Fluxions, would have anticipated all rivalry, and secured him from the contentious claims of Leibnitz. Still each one will solve the problem of his existence in his own way, and, with a manlike Newton, his own, as we conceive, could be no other than the best way. The conduct of Leibnitz in this affair is quite irreconcilable with the stature and strength of the man ; giant-like, and doing nobly, in many ways, a giant's work, yet cringing himself into the dimensions and performances of a common calumniator.

That when Mr. Leibnitz was the first time in London, he contended for the invention of another differential method, properly so called ; and, notwithstanding he was shown by Dr. Pell that it was Newton?s method, persisted in maintaining it to be his own invention, by reason that he had found it by himself without knowing what Newton had done before, and had much improved it. And we find no mention of his having any other differential method than Newton's before his letter of the 21st of June, 1677, which was a year after a copy of Mr. Newton's letter of the 10th of December, 1672, had been sent to Paris to be communicated to him ; and above four years after Mr. Collins began to communicate that letter to his correspondents ; in which letter the method of fluxions was sufficiently described to any intelligent person. \"III. That by Mr. Newton's letter, of the 13th of June, 1676 it appears that he had the method of fluxions above five years before the writing of that letter. And by his Analysis per ^Equa- tiones numero Terminorum Infmitas, communicated by Dr. Barrow to Mr. Collins, in July, 1669, we find that he had invented the method before that time. \"IV. That the differential method is one and the same with the method of fluxions, excepting the name and mode of notation ; Mr. Leibnitz calling those quantities differences which Mr. Newton calls moments, or fluxions ; and marking them with a letter d — a mark not used by Mr. Newton. \" And, therefore, we take the proper question to be, not who invented this or that method, but, who was the first inventor of the method ?

At the recommendation of one of his uncles, who had himself studied at Trinity College, Cambridge, Newton proceeded thither, and was duly admitted. on the 5th day of June 1660, in the eighteenth year of his age. The eager student had now entered upon a new and wider field ; and we find him devoting himself to the pursuit of know ledge with amazing ardour and perseverance. Among other sub jects, his attention was soon drawn to that of Judicial Astrology He exposed the folly of this pseudo-science by erecting a figure with the aid of one or two of the problems of Euclid ; — and thus began his study of the Mathematics. His researches into this science were prosecuted with unparallelled vigour and success. Regarding the propositions contained in Euclid as self-evident truths, he passed rapidly over this ancient system — a step which he afterward much regretted — and mastered, without further pre paratory study, the Analytical Geometry of Descartes. Wallis's Arithmetic of Infinites, Saunderson's Logic, and the Optics of Kepler, he also studied with great care ; writing upon them many comments ; and, in these notes on Wallis's work was un doubtedly the germ of his fluxionary calculus. His progress was so great that he found himself more profoundly versed than his tutor in many branches of learning. Yet his acquisitions were not gotten with the rapidity of intuition ; but they were thoroughly made and firmly secured. Quickness of apprehension, or Intel lectual nimbleness did not belong to him. He saw too far : his, insight was too deep. He dwelt fully, cautiously upon the least subject ; while to the consideration of the greatest, he brought a massive strength joined with a matchless clearness, that, regard less of the merely trivial or unimportant, bore with unerring sa gacity upon the prominences of the subject, and, grappling with its difficulties, rarely failed to surmount them. 14 LIFE OF SIR ISAAC NEWTON His early and fast friend, Dr. Barrow — in compass of inven tion only inferior to Newton — who had been elected Professor of Greek in the University, in 1660, was made Lucasian Profes sor of Mathematics in 1663, and soon afterward delivered his Optical Lectures : the manuscripts of these were revised by New ton, and several overs",
