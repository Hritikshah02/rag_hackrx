2025-07-31 23:43:58,430 - ImprovedSemanticChunker - INFO - Final Answer: Newton explains orbital motion by resolving centripetal forces into components that either maintain motion within a plane or directly attract a body towards a central point, causing it to revolve.

--- Processing Question 10: In what way does Newton's notion of absolute space and time differ from relative motion, and how does it support his laws? ---

2025-07-31 23:44:01,282 - ImprovedSemanticChunker - INFO - Final Answer: Newton's absolute space and time are independent of any external objects or motions, differing from relative motion which is defined by the relationship between objects, thereby providing a fixed framework to support his laws of motion.
