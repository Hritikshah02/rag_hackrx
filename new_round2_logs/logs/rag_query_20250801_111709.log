2025-08-01 11:20:23,822 - ImprovedSemanticChunker - INFO - Final Answer: Newton defines 'quantity of motion' as the measure arising from velocity and quantity of matter, distinct from 'force' which is an action exerted to change a body's state.

2025-08-01 11:20:25,623 - ImprovedSemanticChunker - INFO - Final Answer: Newton derives Kepler's Second Law by showing that a centripetal force, acting successively at points along a body's path, causes it to describe equal areas in equal times, with the areas being proportional to the times of description.

2025-08-01 11:20:27,374 - ImprovedSemanticChunker - INFO - Final Answer: Newton argued that gravitational force must act on all masses universally because experiments showed that all bodies, regardless of their composition, fall at the same rate in a vacuum, implying the force is proportional to their quantity of matter.

2025-08-01 11:20:29,331 - ImprovedSemanticChunker - INFO - Final Answer: Newton used geometrical synthesis and his method of fluxions, which was the precursor to calculus, and he preferred the geometrical method over algebraic calculations as seen in his disapproval of Descartes' approach and his own "Universal Arithmetic" which contrasted with Descartes' "Geometry."

2025-08-01 11:20:32,194 - ImprovedSemanticChunker - INFO - Final Answer: Newton distinguishes absolute space and time as immutable frameworks for true motion, which is caused by impressed forces, from relative motion, which is observed in relation to other bodies and can be altered without direct force.
